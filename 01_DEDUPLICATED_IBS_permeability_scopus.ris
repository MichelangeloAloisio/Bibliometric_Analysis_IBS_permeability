AB  - Background & Aims: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) shows genetic predisposition, and large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are emerging, based on heterogeneous disease definitions. We investigated the genetic architecture of IBS defined according to gold standard Rome Criteria. Methods: We conducted GWAS meta-analyses of Rome III IBS and its subtypes in 24,735 IBS cases and 77,149 asymptomatic control subjects from 2 independent European cohorts (UK Biobank and Lifelines). Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability (h2SNP) and genetic correlations (rg) with other traits were calculated. IBS risk loci were functionally annotated to identify candidate genes. Sensitivity and conditional analyses were conducted to assess impact of confounders. Polygenic risk scores were computed and tested in independent datasets. Results: Rome III IBS showed significant SNP-heritability (up to 13%) and similar genetic architecture across subtypes, including those with manifestations at the opposite ends of the symptom spectrum (rg = 0.48 between IBS-D and IBS-C). Genetic correlations with other traits highlighted commonalities with family history of heart disease and hypertension, coronary artery disease, and angina pectoris (rg = 0.20–0.45), among others. Four independent GWAS signals (P < 5×10-8) were detected, including 2 novel loci for IBS (rs2035380) and IBS-mixed (rs2048419) that had been previously associated with hypertension and coronary artery disease. Functional annotation of GWAS risk loci revealed genes implicated in circadian rhythm (BMAL1), intestinal barrier (CLDN23), immunomodulation (MFHAS1), and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway (ADCY2). Polygenic risk scores allowed the identification of individuals at increased risk of IBS (odds ratio, 1.34; P = 1.1×10-3). Conclusions: Rome III Criteria capture higher SNP-heritability than previously estimated for IBS. The identified link between IBS and cardiovascular traits may contribute to the delineation of alternative therapeutic strategies, warranting further investigation. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Low-profile and transient ingestible electronic capsules for diagnostics and therapeutics can replace widely used yet invasive procedures such as endoscopies. Several gastrointestinal diseases such as reflux disease, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis result in increased intercellular dilation in epithelial barriers. Currently, the primary method of diagnosing and monitoring epithelial barrier integrity is via endoscopic tissue biopsies followed by histological imaging. Here, a gelatin-based ingestible electronic capsule that can monitor epithelial barriers via electrochemical impedance measurements is proposed. Toward this end, material-specific transfer printing methodologies to manufacture soft-gelatin-based electronics, an in vitro synthetic disease model to validate impedance-based sensing, and tests of capsules using ex vivo using porcine esophageal tissue are described. The technologies described herein can advance next generation of oral diagnostic devices that reduce invasiveness and improve convenience for patients. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Growing evidence indicates that visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In animal models, these changes are known to be mediated via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)-proinflammatory cytokine signaling. Apelin, an endogenous ligand of APJ, was reported to modulate CRF-induced enhanced colonic motility. In this context, we hypothesized that apelin also modulates visceral sensation and gut barrier, and tested this hypothesis. We measured visceral pain threshold in response to colonic balloon distention by abdominal muscle contractions assessed by electromyogram in rats. Colonic permeability was estimated by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue. Intraperitoneal (ip) administration of [Ala13]-apelin-13, an APJ antagonist, blocked lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or CRF-induced visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability (IBS model) in a dose-response manner. These inhibitory effects were blocked by compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor or naloxone in the LPS model. On the other hand, ip [Pyr1]-apelin-13, an APJ agonist, caused visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability, and these effects were reversed by astressin, a CRF receptor antagonist, TAK-242, a TLR4 antagonist or anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. APJ system modulated CRF-TLR4-proinflammatory cytokine signaling to cause visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. APJ antagonist blocked these GI changes in IBS models, which were mediated via AMPK, NO and opioid signaling. Apelin may contribute to the IBS pathophysiology, and the inhibition of apelinergic signaling may be a promising therapeutic option for IBS. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) and gut microbiota dysbiosis significantly contribute to the occurrence and development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), exacerbated by stress. Apigenin, a natural flavonoid derived from plants, possesses a range of beneficial properties. However, additional research is necessary to investigate its potential in alleviating symptoms of IBS and elucidating its underlying mechanisms of action. Our study confirms that apigenin effectively reverses mast cell and microglial activation, regulates the composition and abundance of the gut microbiota, improves intestinal barrier function in rats induced with water-avoidance stress, and mitigates VH and colonic hypermotility. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest a potential role of dysbiotic gut microbiota in activating mast cells at the cellular level. Notably, apigenin inhibits mast cell degranulation through the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) / myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) / nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. In conclusion, this study discusses the potential therapeutic effects of apigenin in alleviating VH and modulating the gut-brain axis in water-avoidance stress rats, providing a novel or alternative treatment approach for IBS. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), associated with increased intestinal permeability, inflammation, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, can be triggered by acute gastroenteritis. Cytolethal distending toxin B (CdtB) is produced by gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and may underlie IBS-D development, through molecular mimicry with vinculin. Here, we examine the effects of exposure to CdtB alone on gut microbiome composition, host intestinal gene expression, and IBS-D-like phenotypes in a rat model. CdtB-inoculated rats exhibited increased anti-CdtB levels, which correlated with increased stool wet weights, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL2) and predicted microbial metabolic pathways including inflammatory responses, TNF responses, and diarrhea. Three distinct ileal microbiome profiles (microtypes) were identified in CdtB-inoculated rats. The first microtype (most like controls) had altered relative abundance (RA) of genera Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, and Rothia. The second had lower microbial diversity, higher Escherichia-Shigella RA, higher absolute E. coli abundance, and altered host ileal tissue expression of immune-response and TNF-response genes compared to controls. The third microtype had higher microbial diversity, higher RA of hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producer Desulfovibrio, and increased expression of H2S-associated pain/serotonin response genes. All CdtB-inoculated rats exhibited decreased ileal expression of cell junction component mRNAs, including vinculin-associated proteins. Significantly, cluster-specific microRNA-mRNA interactions controlling intestinal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity/pain, and gastrointestinal motility genes, including several previously associated with IBS were seen. These findings demonstrate that exposure to CdtB toxin alone results in IBS-like phenotypes including inflammation and diarrhea-like stool, decreased expression of intestinal barrier components, and altered ileal microtypes that influenced changes in microRNA-modulated gene expression and predicted metabolic pathways consistent with specific IBS-D symptoms. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is considered a disorder of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), presenting as chronic abdominal pain and altered defaecation. Symptoms are often food related. Much work in the field has focused on identifying physiological, immune and microbial abnormalities in the colon of patients; however, evidence of small intestinal immune activation and microbial imbalance has been reported in small studies. The significance of such findings has been largely underappreciated despite a growing body of work implicating small intestinal homeostatic imbalance in the pathogenesis of DGBIs. Main text: Small intestinal mechanosensation is a characteristic feature of IBS. Furthermore, altered small intestinal barrier functions have been demonstrated in IBS patients with the diarrhoea-predominant subtype. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased populations of small intestinal mast cells are frequently associated with IBS, implicating microbial imbalance and low-grade inflammation in the pathogenesis of IBS. Furthermore, reports of localised food hypersensitivity responses in IBS patients implicate the small intestine as the site of immune-microbial-food interactions. Conclusions: Given the association of IBS symptoms with food intake in a large proportion of patients and the emerging evidence of immune activation in these patients, the current literature suggests the pathogenesis of IBS is not limited to the colon but rather may involve dysfunction of the entire intestinal tract. It remains unclear if regional variation in IBS pathology explains the various symptom phenotypes and further work should consider the intestinal tract as a whole to answer this question. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). In order to explore the mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment on intestinal mucosal barrier, this study observed the effect of EA on aquaporins (AQPs), tight junctions (TJs), NF-κB pathway and the gut microbiota in IBS-D rats. Methods: The IBS-D model was established by acetic acid enema combined with chronic restraint method. The effects of EA on the treatment of IBS-D were examined by the abdominal withdrawal reflex score, Bristol's fecal character score, fecal water content, small intestine propulsion rate and HE staining. AQPs, TJs and inflammation-related molecular mechanisms were explored. The fecal samples were applied for 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the effect of EA intervention to the intestinal bacterial abundance. Results: EA reduced intestinal sensitization, restored intestinal motility and improved inflammatory cell infiltration. Furthermore, EA improved intestinal inflammation and flora environment significantly, inhibited NF-κB signaling and inflammatory factors (IL-1β and TNF-α). It can also increase the gene and protein expression of AQPs (AQP1, AQP3, and AQP8) and the gene levels of TJs (ZO-1 and Occludin). Conclusion: EA has an inhibitory effect on the NF-κB signaling pathway, and regulates the proteins of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8, and TJs to restore the balance of water metabolism and intestinal permeability in IBS-D, which also restored the function of the intestinal mucosa by regulating the intestinal flora. Graphical Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) is a common gastrointestinal disease in clinical practice, which was affected by intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction, intestinal mucosal inflammation production and abnormal intestinal flora, then there is currently no specific drug for treating IBS-D. Electroacupuncture (EA), as a non-pharmacological therapy, has good therapeutic effects in treating IBS-D. Aquaporins (AQPs) are distributed in the intestinal mucosa of the intestine and are important factors in mediating water–liquid transmembrane transport. Changes in AQPs expression have been identified as a common factor in the etiology of certain gastrointestinal diseases. AQP1, AQP3, and AQP8 are distributed in the distal colon. EA can inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway, and regulate the proteins of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8, and TJs to restore the balance of water metabolism and intestinal permeability in IBS-D, which also can restore the function of the intestinal mucosa by regulating the intestinal flora.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional intestinal disorder without clear pathological mechanisms. Classical treatments for IBS are not always effective and are usually accompanied by side effects. Selenium-enriched Bifidobacterium longum DD98 (Se-B. longum DD98) is a selenized probiotic strain which has shown many beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal tract, but its effects on IBS and the underlying mechanism are unclear. This study aims to investigate the relieving effects of Se-B. longum DD98 on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced IBS in mice. The model mice were treated with saline, B. longum DD98, or Se-B. longum DD98 while receiving CUMS. The results suggest that Se-B. longum DD98 significantly relieved the intestinal symptoms of IBS mice and reduced intestinal permeability and inflammation. The depression and anxiety-like behaviors of IBS mice were also improved by Se-B. longum DD98. In addition, the expression of serotonin (5-HT), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are indicators closely related to mood and brain-gut axis, were up-regulated in mice treated with Se-B. longum DD98. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA sequencing study showed that Se-B. longum DD98 effectively restored the relative abundance of intestinal microbes (e.g., Lactobacillus, Desulfovibrio, Akkermansia) and regulated the impaired diversity of gut microbiota in IBS mice. These results suggest that Se-B. longum DD98 positively acts on the brain-gut axis by improving intestinal functions and regulating mood-associated behaviors and indicators of IBS mice. Therefore, this Se-enriched probiotic strain could be considered a promising candidate for the alleviation of CUMS-induced IBS. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: Disruptions of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) are frequently observed in various digestive diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study assessed the improvement in the IEB during the laxative activity of phlorotannin (Pt) harvested from Ecklonia cava in constipation by examining the changes in the expression of the regulatory proteins for the tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ), and inflammatory cytokines in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with loperamide (Lm)-induced constipation after a Pt treatment. Results: The Pt treatment induced laxative activity, including the improvement of feces-related parameters, gastrointestinal transit rate, and histological structure of the mid colon in Lm-treated SD rats. In addition, significant recovery effects were detected in the histology of IEB, including the mucus layer, epithelial cells, and lamina propria in the mid colon of Lm + Pt treated SD rats. The expression levels of E-cadherin and p120-catenin for AJ and the ZO-1, occludin, and Claudin-1 genes for TJ in epithelial cells were improved remarkably after the Pt treatment, but the rate of increase was different. Furthermore, the Pt treatment increased the expression level of several inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-13, and IL-4 in Lm + Pt treated SD rats. Conclusions: These results provide the first evidence that the laxative activity of Pt in SD rats with Lm-induced constipation phenotypes involve improvements in the IEB. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests a link between atopic dermatitis (AD) and gastrointestinal disorders, particularly in relation to gut microbial dysbiosis. This study explored the potential exacerbation of AD by gut inflammation and microbial imbalances using an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) mouse model. Chronic gut inflammation was induced in the model by intrarectal injection of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), followed by a 4-week development period. We noted significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the colon and evident gut microbial dysbiosis in the IBS mice. Additionally, these mice exhibited impaired gut barrier function, increased permeability, and elevated systemic inflammation markers such as IL-6 and LPS. A subsequent MC903 challenge on the right cheek lasting for 7 days revealed more severe AD symptoms in IBS mice compared to controls. Further, fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) from IBS mice resulted in aggravated AD symptoms, a result similarly observed with FMT from an IBS patient. Notably, an increased abundance of Alistipes in the feces of IBS mice correlated with heightened systemic and localized inflammation in both the gut and skin. These findings collectively indicate that chronic gut inflammation and microbial dysbiosis in IBS are critical factors exacerbating AD, highlighting the integral relationship between gut and skin health. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: A probiotic mixture prevented epithelial barrier impairment in various experimental models. The objective was to evaluate its effects in patients suffering from IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) with confirmed leaky gut. Methods: IBS-D patients with increased intestinal permeability measured by radionuclide tracers were enrolled in this pilot, open-label, prospective, interventional, single-center, Phase IV study. Patients received two capsules of a multistrain probiotic a day for 30 days and were evaluated by repeated intestinal permeability tests, the Bristol Stool Scale, and patient-perceived quality of life and satisfaction. Results: Of the 30 enrolled patients (mean age: 42.1 [SD: 13.1] years; female: 60%), 27 completed the study (full analysis set [FAS]), and 18 had no major protocol violation (per protocol set [PPS]). On D30, an improvement of intestinal permeability was observed in 81.5% of patients in FAS, normalization being observed in 37% of the participants (44% in PPS). The mean intestinal permeability was significantly decreased: baseline minus D30, 3.4 (95% CI: 1.7, 5.2); the IBS-QOL total score was significantly increased: D30 minus baseline, 8.0 (95% CI: 3.0, 12.9); and stool consistency was significantly improved. On D15 and D30, 96.3% of patients claimed that their IBS symptoms had been satisfactory alleviated, and a significant improvement was reported for the following VAS-IBS items: abdominal pain, diarrhea, and impact of gastrointestinal problems in daily life. Compliance and tolerance were satisfactory. Conclusion: The multistrain probiotic tested may reduce intestinal permeability in a considerable proportion of patients and may improve abdominal pain, stool consistency, and quality of life. These results pave the way for larger, placebo-controlled clinical studies.  © 2023 S. Karger AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Changji'an Formula (CJAF) is a Chinese herbal compound, which is effective against irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) in clinic. However, the molecular mechanism has not been well defined. In the current study, the potential targets and signaling pathways of CJAF against IBS-D were predicted using network pharmacology analysis. The pharmacological mechanisms of CJAF against IBS-D and the potential mechanism were validated by using an IBS-D mouse model induced by enema with trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) plus with restraint stress and further intervened with CJAF. A total of 232 active compounds of CJAF were obtained, a total of 397 potential targets for the active ingredients were retrieved and a total of 219 common targets were obtained as the potential targets of CJAF against IBS-D. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that multiple targets were enriched and could be experimentally validated in a mouse model of IBS-D. The mechanisms were mainly converged on the immune and inflammatory pathways, especially the NF-κB, TNF and IL-17 signaling pathway, which were closely involved in the treatment of CJAF against IBS-D. Animal experiment showed that CJAF alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and diarrhea symptom of IBS-D. CJAF also restored the histological and ultrastructure damage of IBS-D. The result of western blot showed that CJAF upregulated colonic tight junction proteins of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1. Further results demonstrated that CJAF inhibited the protein expression of NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway targets and downregulated proinflammatory mediators of IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α. In conclusion, CJAF could effectively reduce inflammatory response and alleviate visceral hypersensitivity as well as diarrhea symptom of IBS-D by inhibiting the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway. This study not only reveals the mechanism of CJAF against IBS-D, but also provides a novel therapeutic strategy for IBS-D. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by visceral pain, impaired intestinal barrier and a disorder of the microbiota. DXL-A-24 has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neuropeptides and inflammatory factors. In this study, we used chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced IBS model, to assess the action of DXL-A-24 on visceral hypersensitivity, barrier function and microbiota. Visceral sensation was assessed by colorectal distension in a model of IBS. The expressions of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot, the contents of diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic acid were detected by ELISA, and 16S rRNA to detect the diversity of gut microbiota. CUMS reduced visceral pain threshold and increased colonic permeability of rats. DXL-A-24 for 28 days inhibited these changes. DXL-A-24 also decreased the expression of SP, CGRP in colon and D-LA, DAO in serum. Besides, DXL-A-24 increased the richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota. In conclusions, DXL-A-24 reduced visceral sensitivity, improved intestinal barrier and regulated gut microbiota in rats with IBS. © 2023

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects a substantial quote of adult subjects. Alternate bowel movements and flatulence are the prevalent symptoms in IBS patients. A new medical device containing partially hydrolyzed gum guar (PHGG) and simethicone is presently available also in Italy. The present preliminary experience explored its usefulness in IBS patients. METHODS: After a negative colonoscopy, IBS patients were subdivided into two groups: Group A took a two-month cycle of the MD, whereas Group B did not take the medical device (MD). However, all patients had a standard management (diet and medications). The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measured the perception of symptom severity (abdominal pain, distention, flatulence, constipation, diarrhea, and incomplete bowel movement). Patients were evaluated at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: This preliminary experience included 50 patients (30 females and 20 males; mean age of 45.1 years). The medical device significantly reduced abdominal pain, distension, and flatulence in comparison with standard therapy alone (P<0.001, 0.042, and <0.01, respectively) after 8 weeks. Interestingly, abdominal distension was significantly improved just after 4 weeks (P=0.031). The treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The current preliminary experience showed that PHGG plus simethicone may represent an effective and safe add-on option in managing IBS patients. Therefore, this MD could be considered in the IBS management, mainly concerning the pathophysiological role exerted by intestinal barrier alterations and the microbiota-host interaction. © 2023 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

AB  - During and following the processing of a plant’s raw material, considerable amounts are wasted, composted, or redistributed in non-alimentary sectors for further use (for example, some forms of plant waste contribute to biofuel, bioethanol, or biomass production). However, many of these forms of waste still consist of critical bioactive compounds used in the food industry or medicine. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders. The primary treatment is based on symptomatology alleviation and controlled dietary management. Thus, this review aimed to describe the possible relevance of molecules residing in plant waste that can be used to manage IBS and co-occurring symptoms. Significant evidence was found that many forms of fruit, vegetable, and medicinal plant waste could be the source of some molecules that could be used to treat or prevent stool consistency and frequency impairments and abdominal pain, these being the main IBS symptoms. While many of these molecules could be recovered from plant waste during or following primary processing, the studies suggested that enriched food could offer efficient valorization and prevent further changes in properties or stability. In this way, root, stem, straw, leaf, fruit, and vegetable pomaces were found to consist of biomolecules that could modulate intestinal permeability, pain perception, and overall gastrointestinal digestive processes. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: The Chang-Kang-Fang (CKF) formula, a traditional Chinese herbal formula, can decrease serotonin (5-HT) levels and treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Probiotics have a better synergistic effect on diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) when combined with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The present study aimed to elucidate the efficacy and the mechanisms of action of the CKF formula combined with bifid triple viable capsules (PFK) against IBS-D. Methods: The rat models of IBS-D were induced by gavage with senna decoction plus restraint stress. The CKF formula, PFK and their combination were administered to the rats. Their effects were evaluated based on general condition of the rats and the AWR score. The levels of 5-HT and fos protein in the colon and hippocampus were measured by immunohistochemistry. The levels of SP and VIP, as well as ZO-1 and occludin in the colon, were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry. The intestinal microbiota in faeces was analyzed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. Results: The results showed that the oral CKF formula combined with PFK (CKF + PFK) could significantly relieve the symptoms of IBS-D, including elevating the weight rate and decreasing the AWR score. Compared with the MC group, administration of CKF + PFK significantly reduced the expression of fos in the colon and hippocampus and that of 5-HT, SP and VIP in the colon and increased the levels of 5-HT in the hippocampus and ZO-1 and occludin in the colon. The above indexes exhibited statistical significance in the CKF + PFK group relative to those in the other groups. Moreover, treatment with CKF + PFK improved the diversity of intestinal microbiota and the abundance of Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae but decreased those of Bacteroidetes and Prevotellaceae. Conclusions: The CKF formula combined with PFK may have a synergistic effect on IBS-D by slowing gastrointestinal motility, lowering visceral hypersensitivity, enhancing the intestinal barrier function and modulating the composition of intestinal microbiota.

AB  - Background: Increasing evidence suggests the beneficial effects of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but little is known about how they can impact the gut microbiota. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of a multistrain probiotic on IBS symptoms, gut permeability and gut microbiota in patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Methods: Adults with IBS-D were enrolled in an open-label trial to receive a multistrain probiotic for 4 weeks. Abdominal pain, stool frequency, quality of life, gut permeability, and the luminal and adherent microbiota from colonic biopsies were evaluated before and after supplementation. Results: Probiotics significantly improved symptoms and quality of life, despite having no impact on permeability in the global population. In the population stratified by the response, the diarrhoea responders displayed reduced colonic permeability after supplementation. The luminal and adherent microbiota were specifically altered depending on the patients’ clinical responses regarding pain and diarrhoea. Interestingly, we identified a microbial signature in IBS-D patients that could predict a response or lack of response to supplementation. Conclusions: The multistrain probiotic improved the symptoms of IBS-D patients and induced distinct effects on the gut microbiota according to the patient’s clinical response and initial microbiota composition. Our study further supports the need to develop individualised probiotic-based approaches regarding IBS. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity and leaky gut, which are mediated via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and Toll-like receptor 4 are key pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Metformin was reported to improve these gastrointestinal (GI) changes. In this study, we attempted to determine the effects of imeglimin, which was synthesized from metformin on GI function in IBS rat models. Imeglimin blocked lipopolysaccharide- or CRF-induced visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. These effects were prevented by compound C or naloxone. These results suggest that imeglimin may be effective for the treatment of IBS by improved visceral sensation and colonic barrier via AMPK and opioid receptor. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Chang-Kang-Fang formula (CKF), a multi-herb traditional Chinese medicinal formula, has been clinically used for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). Though we have reported the compounds of CKF and their therapeutic effect on IBS-D rats, the exact underlying mechanism is still not clear. The aim of this study was to clearly define the effect of CKF on IBS-D by regulating gut microbiota and promoting intestinal barrier. IBS-D rats were established by psychosocial stress (restraint) combined with the peripheral stimulation (senna leaf gavage) stress. The changes of body weight and the number of fecal pellets were investigated during the experiment. The effect on intestinal sensitivity was assessed based on the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores and the intestinal permeability, the expression of zona occludens 1 (ZO-1), measured by immunohistochemistry. The composition of gut microbiota was detected through 16S rRNA. The administration of CKF significantly had therapeutic effects on IBS-D rats based on the decreased AWR scores and the increased number of pellets. However, the changes of body weight were not observed. In addition, CKF could up-regulate the expression of ZO-1 in the colon and rebalance the gut microbiota of IBS-D by increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus, Allobaculum, Roseburia, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136. CKF potentially alleviated IBS-D through regulating gut microbiota and improving the intestinal barrier function. © 2022 Science Society of Thailand under Royal Patronage. All rights reserved.

AB  - Probiotics have great potential in regulating intestinal pain. In this study, the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum AR495 on the visceral sensitivity and gut microbiota of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rats were studied. The results showed that tryptase released after mast cell activation and degranulation plays a key role in visceral pain, and L. plantarum AR495 reduced the stimulation of colonic mast cells and the expression of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and TRPV1 in dorsal root ganglia. Research further showed that supplementation with L. plantarum AR495 increased the level of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and enhanced the barrier function of the colo n. In addition, the microbiota analysis of the colon indicated that L. plantarum AR495 promoted the proliferation of Bifidobacterium and inhibited the proliferation of Lachnospiraceae, which alleviated the imbalance of the intestinal microbiota caused by IBS to a certain extent. In total, L. plantarum AR495 might reduce visceral sensitivity through the Mast cell-PAR2-TRPV1 signaling pathway by maintaining the homeostasis of the intestinal barrier. © 2024 Beijing Academy of Food Sciences.

AB  - Probiotic supplementation can help to mitigate the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by reinforcing the intestinal barrier, and reducing both inflammation and proteolytic activity. Here, a combination of in vitro tests was performed on 33 Bifidobacterium strains as probiotic candidates for IBS. In addition to the classical tests performed, the detection of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) enzyme capable of decreasing the high proteolytic activity found in IBS patients was included. Three serpin-positive strains were selected: Bifidobacterium breve CNCM I-5644, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis CNCM I-5645 and B. longum CNCM I-5646 for their immunomodulation properties and protection of intestinal epithelial integrity in vitro. Furthermore, we found that B. breve CNCM I-5644 strain prevented intestinal hyperpermeability by upregulating Cingulin and Tight Junction Protein 1 mRNA levels and reducing pro-inflammatory markers. The ability of CNCM I-5644 strain to restore intestinal hyperpermeability (FITC-dextran) was shown in the murine model of low-grade inflammation induced by dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS). This effect of this strain was corroborated in a second model of IBS, the neonatal maternal separation model in mice. Altogether, these data suggest that serpin-positive B. breve CNCM I-5644 may partially prevent disorders associated with increased barrier permeability such as IBS. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder for which dietary interventions can be a useful treatment. In recent years, the low-FODMAP approach is gaining traction in this regard. The fermentation of these non-absorbed carbohydrates by the gut microbiota can generate toxic glycating metabolites, such as methylglyoxal. These metabolites can have harmful effects by their role in the generation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which activates Receptor for AGEs (AGER). Mast cells can be stimulated by AGEs and play a role in IBS. We have treated mice with lactose or fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), with or without co-administration of pyridoxamine and investigated the colonic mucus barrier. We have found that an increased intake of lactose and fructo-oligosaccharides induces a dysregulation of the colonic mucus barrier, increasing mucus discharge in empty colon, while increasing variability and decreasing average thickness mucus layer covering the fecal pellet. Changes were correlated with increased mast cell counts, pointing to a role for the crosstalk between these and goblet cells. Additionally, AGE levels in colonic epithelium were increased by treatment with the selected fermentable carbohydrates. Observed effects were prevented by co-treatment with anti-glycation agent pyridoxamine, implicating glycation processes in the negative impact of fermentable carbohydrate ingestion. This study shows that excessive intake of fermentable carbohydrates can cause colonic mucus barrier dysregulation in mice, by a process that involves glycating agents and increased mucosal mast cell counts. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Brain injuries and neurological diseases have a significant impact on the gut microbiome and the gut barrier. Reciprocally, gut disorders, such as Inflammatory Bowel Syndromes (IBS), can affect the development and pathology of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, although this aspect is less well studied and is the focus of this review. Inflammatory Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic and debilitating functional gastrointestinal disorder afflicting an estimated 9–23% of the world's population. A hallmark of this disease is leaky gut, a pathology in which the integrity of the gut blood barrier is compromised, causing gut contents such as immune cells and microbiota to enter the bloodstream leading to low-grade systemic inflammation. The increased levels of inflammation associated cytokines in circulation has the potential to affect all organs, including the brain. Although the brain is protected by the blood brain barrier, inflammation associated cytokines can damage the junctions in this barrier and allow brain infiltration of peripheral immune cells. Central inflammation in the brain is associated with various neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders, namely, depression, and anxiety. Neurodegenerative diseases are of particular concern due to the anticipated rise in the population of the elderly and consequently, the prevalence of these diseases. Additionally, depression and anxiety are the most common mental illnesses affecting roughly 18% of the American population. In this review, we will explore the mechanisms by which IBS can influence the risk and severity of neurological disease. © 2022

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder, but its diagnosis and treatment remain obscure. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), as potential biomarkers, have attracted increasing attention in digestive diseases. Here, we present a comprehensive research status, development trends, and valuable insights in this subject area. The literature search was performed using Web of Science Core Collection. VOSviewer 1.6.20, Citespace 6.2.R4, and Microsoft Excel 2021 were used for bibliometric analysis. A total of 124 articles were included in the analysis. Overall, publication patterns fluctuated. Globally, People’s Republic of China, the USA, and Germany were the top three contributors of publications. Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, University of California, Mayo Clinic, and University of California, Los Angeles contributed the highest number of publications. The pathways and specific mechanisms by which ncRNAs regulate transcription and translation and thus regulate the pathophysiological processes of IBS are the main research hotspots in this field. We found that microRNA (miRNAs) are intricately involved in the regulation of key pathologies such as viscera sensitivity, intestinal permeability, intestinal mucosal barrier, immunoinflammatory response, and brain-gut axis in the IBS, and these topics have garnered significant attention in research community. Notably, microecological disorders are also associated with IBS pathogenesis, and ncRNA may play an important role in the interactions between host and intestinal flora. This is the first bibliometric study to comprehensively summarize the research hotspots and trends related to IBS and ncRNAs (especially miRNAs). Our findings will help understand the role of ncRNAs in IBS and provide guidance to future studies. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity resulting from compromised gut barrier with activated immune system is a key feature of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activate proinflammatory cytokine signaling to induce these changes, which is one of the mechanisms of IBS. As activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or TLR4 leads to release interleukin (IL)-1β, the NLRP3 inflammasome may be involved in the pathophysiology of IBS. Tranilast, an anti-allergic drug has been demonstrated to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, and we evaluated the impact of tranilast on visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability induced by LPS or CRF (IBS rat model). Visceral pain threshold caused by colonic balloon distention was measured by monitoring abdominal muscle contractions electrophysiologically. Colonic permeability was determined by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue within the colonic tissue. Colonic protein levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β were assessed by immunoblot or ELISA. Intragastric administration of tranilast (20–200 mg/kg) for 3 days inhibited LPS (1 mg/kg)-induced visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, tranilast also abolished these alterations induced by CRF (50 µg/kg). LPS increased colonic protein levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β, and tranilast inhibited these changes. β-hydroxy butyrate, an NLRP3 inhibitor, also abolished visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability caused by LPS. In contrast, IL-1β induced similar GI alterations to LPS, which were not modified by tranilast. In conclusion, tranilast improved visceral pain and colonic barrier by suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome in IBS rat models. Tranilast may be useful for IBS treating. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intestinal metabolism-related diseases, such as constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer, could be associated with the dysfunction of intestinal mitochondria. The mitochondria of intestinal epithelial cells are of great significance for promoting intestinal motility and maintaining intestinal metabolism. It is necessary for the prophylaxis and therapy of intestinal metabolism-related diseases to improve mitochondrial function. We investigated the effect of 4,6-diamino-2-pyrimidinethiol-modified gold nanoparticles (D-Au NPs) on intestinal mitochondria and studied the regulatory role of D-Au NPs on mitochondria metabolism-related disease. D-Au NPs improved the antioxidation capability of mitochondria, regulated the mitochondrial metabolism, and maintained intestinal cellular homeostasis via the activation of AMPK and regulation of PGC-1α with its downstream signaling (UCP2 and DRP1), enhancing the intestinal mechanical barrier. D-Au NPs improved the intestinal mitochondrial function to intervene in the emergence of constipation, which could help develop drugs to treat and prevent mitochondrial metabolism-related diseases. Our findings provided an in-depth understanding of the mitochondrial effects of Au NPs for improving human intestinal barriers. © 2023 American Chemical Society

AB  - Background: The underlying pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still unclear. Our aim was to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of diarrhea, constipation, and antigen uptake in mixed-type IBS (IBS-M). Methods: Colonoscopic biopsies were obtained from IBS-M patients. Epithelial transport and barrier function of colonic mucosae were characterized in Ussing chambers using impedance spectroscopy. Mucosal permeability to macromolecules was measured. Western blotting for tight junction (TJ) proteins was performed and their subcellular localization was visualized by confocal microscopy. RNA-sequencing was performed for gene expression and signaling pathway analysis. Results: In IBS-M, epithelial resistance and ENaC-dependent sodium absorption were unchanged, while short-circuit current reflecting chloride secretion was reduced. Concomitantly, epithelial permeability for fluorescein and FITC-dextran-4000 increased. TJ protein expression of occludin decreased, whereas claudins were unaltered. Confocal microscopy revealed the de-localization of tricellulin from tricellular TJs. Involved pathways were detected as proinflammatory cytokine pathways, LPS, PGE2, NGF, and vitamin D. Conclusions: Decreased anion secretion explains constipation in IBS-M, while ion permeability and sodium absorption were unaltered. Reduced occludin expression resulted in the delocalization of tricellulin from the tricellular TJ, leading to increased macromolecular permeability that contributes to antigen influx into the mucosa and perpetuates a low-grade inflammatory process. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Alteration of the host-microbiota cross talk at the intestinal barrier may participate in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, we aimed to determine effects of fecal luminal factors from IBS patients on the colonic epithelium using colonoids. Methods: Colon-derived organoid monolayers, colonoids, generated from a healthy subject, underwent stimulation with fecal supernatants from healthy subjects and IBS patients with predominant diarrhea, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cytokines in cell cultures and fecal LPS were measured by ELISA and mRNA gene expression of monolayers was analyzed using Qiagen RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays. The fecal microbiota profile was determined by the GA-map™ dysbiosis test and the fecal metabolite profile was analyzed by untargeted liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Key results: Colonoid monolayers stimulated with fecal supernatants from healthy subjects (n = 7), PBS (n = 4) or LPS (n = 3) presented distinct gene expression profiles, with some overlap (R2Y = 0.70, Q2= 0.43). Addition of fecal supernatants from healthy subjects and IBS patients (n = 9) gave rise to different gene expression profiles of the colonoid monolayers (R2Y = 0.79, Q2= 0.64). Genes (n = 22) related to immune response (CD1D, TLR5) and barrier integrity (CLDN15, DSC2) contributed to the separation. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines in colonoid monolayer cultures were comparable when stimulated with fecal supernatants from either donor types. Fecal microbiota and metabolite profiles, but not LPS content, differed between the study groups. Conclusions: Fecal luminal factors from IBS patients induce a distinct colonic epithelial gene expression, potentially reflecting the disease pathophysiology. The culture of colonoids from healthy subjects with fecal supernatants from IBS patients may facilitate the exploration of IBS related intestinal micro-environmental and barrier interactions. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects and related mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly allocated into normal, model, and EA groups. Experimental IBS mice models were established by exposure to water avoidance stress (WAS). Mice in the EA group were treated with EA at bilateral Tianshu (ST 25) and Zusanli (ST 36) for 7 consecutive days, 15 min each day. Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) tests and intestinal motility tests were performed to evaluate visceral sensitivity and intestinal motility of mice. Expression levels of tight junction proteins (TJPs) and inflammatory cytokines in colon tissues were determined through immunofluorescence, real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and Western blot assays. RESULTS: EA alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal hypermotility in WAS-induced IBS mice. Moreover, EA promoted the expression of zonula occludens (ZO)-1, claudin-1, and occludin while suppressing the expression of interleukin (IL)-8, interferon (IFN)-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-αin water avoidance stress (WAS)-induced irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) mice. CONCLUSION: EA alleviated WAS-induced IBS in mice by promoting intestinal barrier functions and suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines. © 2023 JTCM. All rights reserved.

AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS) is one of the important systems that regulate gastrointestinal function. The ENS is made up of enteric glial cells (EGCs) and neurons. For a long time, it was believed that the function of EGCs was only to give structural support to neurons. However, recent evidence indicates EGCs are involved in most gut functions, including the development and plasticity of the ENS, epithelial barrier, and motility. However, it remains unclear whether EGCs have the potential to modify colonic motility following irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D). This study aimed to investigate changes in EGCs during IBS-D and assessed the effects of manipulating EGCs. An IBS-D rat model was constructed using acetic acid and restraint stress, and DL-fluorocitric acid (FC), an inhibitor of EGCs, was administered. The changes in EGCs and colonic motility were studied by employing techniques comprising morphological, molecular biological and functional experiments. The results showed significant activation of EGCs in the myenteric plexus (MP) of the IBS-D-induced rat colon with accelerated colonic motility. FC significantly reduced the activation of EGCs and colonic motility caused by acetic acid and restraint stress. Hypercontraction of the colon caused by IBS-D may be associated with activation of EGCs in the MP of the colon and this was prevented by FC. Therefore, regulating colon hypercontraction through interference with the activation of EGCs has significant prospects for clinical application to alleviate diarrhea in patients with IBS-D. © 2023

AB  - Introduction: This case report reviewed a female client with numerous pre-existing conditions linked to gastrointestinal(GI)dysbiosisandsystemicinflammation. Gastrointestinal ailments such as acid reflux/ gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD), and increased intestinal permeability (“leaky gut”) are on the rise and growing according to current research. Adjunctive therapies appear safe and are increasing in their use with the management of these conditions. Case Presentation: A 39-year-old female, currently using H2-Receptor antagonists (H2R), presented with long-standing signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) ailments. A nutritional approach (ReNew Food Plan) focusing on client education, increased consumption of foods associated with reduced inflammation, and decreased consumption of processed foods was recommended. These recommendations were made to improve intestinal permeability, balance gut microbiota, and reduce reflux symptoms while decreasing dependency on H2-R medications, restoring regular bowel movements, and increasing immune function, including IgA levels. As a result of the adjustments, the client reported outcomes (CRO) indicated a reduction in signs and symptoms of her gastrointestinal (GI) and immune system ailments from severe and frequent to mild and occasional. Conclusion: The ReNew Food Plan, a “food-first approach” integrated with other interventions, appeared to improve this client’s gastrointestinal (GI) and immune system function safely and effectively. Further studies are needed, especially about the ReNew Food Plan to compare results and show how this specific food plan could work for others. © 2023 InnoVision Communications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is one of the most common causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. One sequela of this infection is the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). It has been suggested that a dysfunctional intestinal barrier may promote IBS development. We aimed to test this hypothesis against the background of the leaky gut concept for low-grade inflammation in PI-IBS. Methods: We identified patients with persistent PI-IBS symptoms after C. jejuni infection. During sigmoidoscopy, forceps biopsies were obtained for electrophysiological measurements of epithelial transport and barrier function in miniaturized Ussing devices. C. jejuni absence was checked by PCR and cytokine production with immunohistochemistry. Results: In PI-IBS, the epithelial resistance of the colon epithelium was unaltered, reflecting an intact paracellular pathway. In contrast, temperature-dependent horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 44 kDa) permeation increased. Short-circuit current (Isc) reflecting active anion secretion and ENaC-dependent electrogenic sodium absorption was unaffected. Early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) and IL-4 levels increased. C. jejuni is not incorporated into the resident microbiota of the colon mucosa in PI-IBS. Conclusions: In PI-IBS after C. jejuni infection, macromolecule uptake via endocytosis was enhanced, leading to low-grade inflammation with pro-inflammatory cytokine release. The findings will allow C. jejuni-induced pathomechanisms to be targeted during infection and, thereafter to reduce sequelae such as PI-IBS. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Gut–brain communications disorders in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are associated with intestinal microbiota composition, increased gut permeability, and psychosocial disturbances. Symptoms of IBS are difficult to medicate, and hence much research is being made into alternative approaches. This study assesses the potential of a treatment with pasteurized Akkermansia muciniphila for alleviating IBS-like symptoms in two mouse models of IBS with different etiologies. Two clinically relevant animal models were used to mimic IBS-like symptoms in C57BL6/J mice: the neonatal maternal separation (NMS) paradigm and the Citrobacter rodentium infection model. In both models, gut permeability, colonic sensitivity, fecal microbiota composition and colonic IL-22 expression were evaluated. The cognitive performance and emotional state of the animals were also assessed by several tests in the C. rodentium infection model. The neuromodulation ability of pasteurized A. muciniphila was assessed on primary neuronal cells from mice dorsal root ganglia using a ratiometric calcium imaging approach. The administration of pasteurized A. muciniphila significantly reduced colonic hypersensitivity in both IBS mouse models, accompanied by a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier function. Beneficial effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila treatment have also been observed on anxiety-like behavior and memory defects in the C. rodentium infection model. Finally, a neuroinhibitory effect exerted by pasteurized A. muciniphila was observed on neuronal cells stimulated with two algogenic substances such as capsaicin and inflammatory soup. Our findings demonstrate novel anti-hyperalgesic and neuroinhibitory properties of pasteurized A. muciniphila, which therefore may have beneficial effects in relieving pain and anxiety in subjects with IBS. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) is characterized by increased intestinal permeability. Previous studies have shown that the microRNA-29 gene is involved in the regulation of intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D. NF-κB was proved to play a key role in inflammatory response of intestine and resultant disruption of tight junction integrity, whose activity could be inhibited by TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3 (TRAF3). However, the exact mechanism that induces increased intestinal permeability in IBS-D patients has not been clarified. In this study, we found that microRNA-29b-3p (miR-29b-3p) was significantly upregulated, while TRAF3 was decreased and the NF-κB-MLCK pathway was activated within the colonic tissue of IBS-D patients. Subsequently, we confirmed the targeting relationship between miR-29b-3p and TRAF3 through a double-luciferase reporter assay. Lentivirus transfection of NCM460 cells with miR-29b-3p-overexpressing and -silencing vectors demonstrated that the expression of TRAF3 was negatively correlated with the level of miR-29b-3p. The NF-κB/MLCK pathway was activated in the miR-29b-3p-overexpressing group and inhibited to some extent in the miR-29b-3p-silencing group. Results in WT and miR-29 knockout mice showed that miR-29b-3p levels were increased, TRAF3 levels were decreased, and the NF-κB/MLCK signaling was activated in the WT IBS-D group as compared with the WT control group. The protein levels of TRAF3 and TJs in the miR-29b-/- IBS-D group were partially recovered and NF-κB/MLCK pathway indicators were, to a certain extent, decreased as compared with the WT IBS-D group. These results suggested that miR-29b-3p deletion enhances the TRAF3 level in IBS-D mice and alleviates the high intestinal permeability. In brief, through the analysis of intestinal tissue samples from IBS-D patients and miR-29b-/- IBS-D mice, we showed that miR-29b-3p is involved in the pathogenesis of intestinal hyperpermeability in IBS-D via targeting TRAF3 to regulate the NF-κB-MLCK signaling pathway.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a multifactorial intestinal disorder, is often associated with a disruption in intestinal permeability as well as an increased expression of pro-inflammatory markers. The aim of this study was to first test the impact of treatment with glutamine (Gln), a food supplement containing natural curcumin extracts and polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (Cur); bioactive peptides from a fish protein hydrolysate (Ga); and a probiotic mixture containing Bacillus coagulans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus helveticus. These compounds were tested alone on a stress-based IBS model, the chronic-restraint stress model (CRS). The combination of Gln, Cur and Ga (GCG) was also tested. Eight-week-old C57Bl/6 male mice were exposed to restraint stress for two hours every day for four days and received different compounds every day one week before and during the CRS procedure. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured as a marker of stress, and colonic permeability was evaluated ex vivo in Ussing chambers. Changes in the gene expression of tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-1 and ZO 1) and inflammatory cytokines (IL1β, TNFα, CXCL1 and IL10) were assessed using RT-qPCR. The CRS model led to an increase in plasma corticosterone and an increase in colonic permeability compared with unstressed animals. No change in plasma corticosterone concentrations was observed in response to CRS with the different treatments (Gln, Cur, Ga or GCG). Stressed animals treated with Gln, Cur and Ga alone and in combination showed a decrease in colonic permeability when compared to the CRS group, while the probiotic mixture resulted in an opposite response. The Ga treatment induced an increase in the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and the GCG treatment was able to decrease the expression of CXCL1, suggesting the synergistic effect of the combined mixture. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a combined administration of glutamine, a food supplement containing curcumin and polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids, and bioactive peptides from a fish hydrolysate was able to reduce colonic hyperpermeability and reduce the inflammatory marker CXCL1 in a stress-based model of IBS and could be of interest to patients suffering from IBS. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Treatment of functional digestive disorders is not always effective. Therefore, a search for new application points for potential drugs is perspective. Our aim is to evaluate the effect of rebamipide on symptom severity, intestinal barrier status, and intestinal microbiota composition and function in patients with diarrheal variant of irritable bowel syndrome overlapping with functional dyspepsia (D-IBSoFD). Sixty patients were randomized to receive trimebutine (TRI group), trimebutine + rebamipide (T + R group), or rebamipide (REB group) for 2 months. At the beginning and end of the study, patients were assessed for general health (SF-36), severity of digestive symptoms (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating and 7 × 7 scales), state of the intestinal barrier, and composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and function (short-chain fatty acid fecal content) of the gut microbiota. The severity of most digestive symptoms was reduced in the REB and T + R groups to levels similar to that observed in the TRI group. The duodenal and sigmoidal lymphocytic and sigmoidal eosinophilic infiltration was decreased only in the REB and T + R groups, not in the TRI group. Serum zonulin levels were significantly decreased only in the REB group. A decrease in intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration in the duodenum correlated with a decrease in the severity of rumbling and flatulence, while a decrease in infiltration within the sigmoid colon correlated with improved stool consistency and decreased severity of the sensation of incomplete bowel emptying. In conclusion, rebamipide improves the intestinal barrier condition and symptoms in D-IBSoFD. The rebamipide effects are not inferior to those of trimebutine. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In the past few years, increasing attention has been given to the pathologic role of specific foods in IBS, like wheat and other cereals. Recent literature describes IBS patients who may experience gastrointestinal (GI) and extra-GI symptoms precipitated by the ingestion of cereals. Tritordeum is a cereal of Spanish origin derived from the hybridization of durum wheat and wild barley. It is different from classic wheat for its gluten protein composition, with fewer carbohydrates and fructans and a higher content of proteins, dietary fibers, and antioxidants. This pilot study aimed to investigate the effects of a 12-week diet with Tritordeum-based foods in substitution of other cereals on the profile of GI symptoms (evaluated by appropriate questionnaire) and the health of the GI barrier (assessed by sugar absorption test and different markers of integrity and functions) in 16 diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients. The diet with Tritordeum-based foods (bread, bakery products, and pasta) significantly reduced IBS-D patients' symptoms. This amelioration appears to occur through an overall improvement of the GI barrier, as demonstrated by the reduced intestinal permeability and the decreased levels of markers of intestinal mucosal integrity, mucosal inflammation, and fermentative dysbiosis.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder linked to intestinal barrier dysfunction and life stress. We have previously reported that female sex per se determines an increased susceptibility to intestinal barrier dysfunction after cold pain stress (CPS). We aimed to identify sex-related molecular differences in response to CPS in healthy subjects to understand the origin of sex bias predominance in IBS. In 13 healthy males and 21 females, two consecutive jejunal biopsies were obtained using Watson’s capsule, at baseline, and ninety minutes after CPS. Total mucosal RNA and protein were isolated from jejunal biopsies. Expression of genes related to epithelial barrier (CLDN1, CLDN2, OCLN, ZO-1, and ZO-3), mast cell (MC) activation (TPSAB1, SERPINA1), and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) were analyzed using RT-qPCR. NR3C1, ZO-1 and OCLN protein expression were evaluated through immunohistochemistry and western blot, and mucosal inflammation through MC, lymphocyte, and eosinophil numbering. Autonomic, hormonal, and psychological responses to CPS were monitored. We found an increase in jejunal MCs, a reduced CLDN1 and OCLN expression, and an increased CLDN2 and SERPINA1 expression 90 min after CPS. We also found a significant decrease in ZO-1, OCLN, and NR3C1 gene expression, and a decrease in OCLN protein expression only in females, when compared to males. CPS induced a significant increase in blood pressure, plasma cortisol and ACTH, and subjective stress perception in all participants. Specific and independent sex-related molecular responses in epithelial barrier regulation are unraveled by acute stress in the jejunum of healthy subjects and may partially explain female predominance in IBS. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The prostone analog, lubiprostone, is approved to manage constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Lubiprostone also protects intestinal mucosal barrier function in animal models of colitis. The aim of this study was to determine if lubiprostone improves barrier properties in isolated colonic biopsies from Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Sigmoid colon biopsies from healthy subjects, CD and UC patients in remission, and CD patients with active disease were mounted in Ussing chambers. Tissues were treated with lubiprostone or vehicle to determine the effects on transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), FITC-dextran 4kD (FD4) permeability, and electrogenic ion transport responses to forskolin and carbachol. Localization of the tight junction protein, occludin, was determined by immunofluorescence. Lubiprostone significantly increased ion transport across control, CD and UC remission biopsies but not active CD. Lubiprostone selectively improved TER in both CD remission and active disease biopsies but not in control or UC biopsies. The improved TER was associated with increased membrane localization of occludin. Lubiprostone selectively improved barrier properties of biopsies from CD patients vs. UC and independent of an ion transport response. These data indicate that lubiprostone has potential efficacy in improving mucosal integrity in Crohn’s disease. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Disturbances in the intestinal barrier and gut dysbiosis have been observed in patients with functional bowel diseases. Aims: To investigate the correlation between biomarkers of intestinal barrier disorders at different layers and the severity of symptoms in patients with overlapping diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia (IDFO), as well as with gut microbiota taxa. Methods: This study included 45 patients with IDFO and 16 healthy controls. Endoscopy with biopsy of the duodenum and sigmoid colon (SC) was performed to count intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and mucosal eosinophils (subepithelial layer), assess fatty acid binding protein (FABP; epithelial layer) level, and stain for mucin-2 (MUC-2; pre-epithelial layer). Composition of the gut microbiota was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results: Patients with IDFO exhibited an increase in biomarkers of intestinal barrier disorders at all layers studied. IEL count in the duodenum was correlated with the severity of bloating (r = 0.336; p = 0.024) and, in the SC, was correlated with tenesmus severity (r = 0.303; p = 0.042). FABP-1 level in the SC was correlated with the severity of diarrhea (r = 0.577; p = 0.001), and FABP-5 concentration in the SC was correlated with abdominal distension (r = 0.477; p = 0.010). MUC-2 concentration in the duodenum was correlated with the severity of heartburn (r = 0.572; p = 0.025) and burning sensation in the epigastrium (r = 0.518; p = 0.048). All biomarkers of intestinal barrier permeability were correlated with the abundance of some gut microbiota taxa. Conclusion: Patients with IDFO exhibited disrupted intestinal barrier function in all layers, which was associated with clinical symptom severity and changes in the gut microbiota.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Serpylli herba extract (SHE), composed of the aerial parts of wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum L.) (Lamiaceae family), is traditionally used in Europe and North Africa to treat diarrhea, gastric ulcers, intestinal parasites and upper respiratory tract infections. Recently, SHE has generated a great interest for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management, probably due to its intestinal anti-inflammatory properties shown in experimental colitis and the fact that its active components could preserve the intestinal barrier integrity, which is altered in patients with IBS. Aim of study: We aimed to test the effects of a SHE in a rat experimental model resembling human IBS. Materials and methods: IBS was provoked by deoxycholic acid (DCA). Rats were then treated with SHE (100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) and different inflammatory and gut barrier integrity markers were evaluated. Moreover, several gut hypersensitivity and hyperalgesia determinations were performed. Results: SHE improved referred pain and visceral hypersensitivity. Additionally, SHE enhanced immune status by downregulating of the expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators Il-1β, Il-6, Ifn-γ, Tlr-4, and the inducible enzyme Cox-2, thus inducing visceral analgesia, and promoting the restore of the gut barrier function by upregulating the mucins Muc-2 and Muc-3. These anti-inflammatory effects could be related to its action on mast cells since it significantly inhibited the β-Hexosaminidase production in RBL-2H3 cells. Lastly, SHE also seems to modulate the serotonin pathway by restoring the altered expression of the 5-HT receptors Htr-3 and Htr-4. Conclusion: SHE could be considered a potential new treatment for IBS, since it ameliorates hypersensitivity, visceral hyperalgesia, and inflammation. These beneficial effects may be due to the inhibition of mast cells degranulation and serotonin pathway.

AB  - Background: Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a prevalent pathogenic factor underlying various disorders. Currently there is no effective resolution. Previous studies have reported the potential anti-inflammatory properties of lidocaine and its ability to alleviate visceral hypersensitivity in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, our study will further verify the effect of lidocaine on intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: In this study, we investigated the role of lidocaine by assessing visceral hypersensitivity, body weight, inflammatory factors, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4000 (FD4) flux, tight junctions (TJs) and spleen and thymus index in rats subjected to water avoidance stress (WAS) to mimic intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS with and without lidocaine. In vitro, we investigated the role of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2) in lidocaine-treated Caco2 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CRHR2. Key Results: In WAS rats, lidocaine significantly restored weight loss, damaged TJs, spleen index and thymus index and inhibited abdominal hypersensitivity as well as blood levels of markers indicating intestinal permeability, such as diamine oxidase (DAO), D-lactic acid (D-Lac) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Consequently, the leakage of FD4 flux from intestine was significantly attenuated in lidocaine group, and levels of intestinal inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α) were reduced. Interestingly, lidocaine significantly suppressed corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels in lamina propria cells, while the CRH receptor CRHR2 was upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells. In vitro, lidocaine enhanced the expression of CRHR2 on Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells and restored disrupted TJs and the epithelial barrier caused by LPS. Conversely, these effects were diminished by a CRHR2 antagonist and siRNA-CRHR2, suggesting that the protective effect of lidocaine depends on CRHR2. Conclusions and Inferences: Lidocaine ameliorates intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS by potentially modulating the expression of CRHR2 on intestinal epithelial cells. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of brain-gut interaction characterised by abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. In the diarrhoea subtype (IBS-D), altered epithelial barrier and mucosal immune activation are associated with clinical manifestations. We aimed to further evaluate plasma cells and epithelial integrity to gain understanding of IBS-D pathophysiology. One mucosal jejunal biopsy and one stool sample were obtained from healthy controls and IBS-D patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms, stress, and depression scores were recorded. In the jejunal mucosa, RNAseq and gene set enrichment analyses were performed. A morphometric analysis by electron microscopy quantified plasma cell activation and proximity to enteric nerves and glycocalyx thickness. Immunoglobulins concentration was assessed in the stool. IBS-D patients showed differential expression of humoral pathways compared to controls. Activation and proximity of plasma cells to nerves and IgG concentration were also higher in IBS-D. Glycocalyx thickness was lower in IBS-D compared to controls, and this reduction correlated with plasma cell activation, proximity to nerves, and clinical symptoms. These results support humoral activity and loss of epithelial integrity as important contributors to gut dysfunction and clinical manifestations in IBS-D. Additional studies are needed to identify the triggers of these alterations to better define IBS-D pathophysiology. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an under-diagnosed common health problem that impairs quality of life. Migraine and IBS are comorbid disorders that are triggered by foods. We aim to investigate IBS frequency in medication overuse headache (MOH) patients and identify food triggers and food avoidance behavior. Methods: Participants who completed the cross-sectional, observational and online survey were included (n = 1118). Demographic data, comorbid disorders, medications used, presence of headache, the diagnostic features of headache and IBS, migraine related subjective cognitive symptoms scale (MigSCog), consumption behavior of patients regarding 125 food/food additives and food triggers were asked about in the questionnaire. Results: Migraine and MOH diagnoses were made in 88% and 30.7% of the participants, respectively. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the main overused drug (89%) in MOH patients. IBS symptoms were present in 35.8% of non-headache sufferers, 52% of migraine patients and 65% of MOH patients. Specific food triggers for MOH patients were dopaminergic and frequently consumed as healthy foods such as banana, apple, cherry, apricot, watermelon, olive, ice cream and yogurt. MigSCog scores were significantly higher in episodic migraine and MOH patients when IBS symptoms coexisted. Conclusions: The frequency of IBS was higher in MOH patients compared to migraine patients. Coexistence of IBS seems to be a confounding factor for cognitive functions. MOH specific triggers were mostly dopaminergic foods, whereas migraine specific food triggers were mostly histaminergic and processed foods. Personalized diets focusing on food triggers and interference with leaky gut must be integrated to MOH and migraine treatment to achieve sustainable management of these disorders. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Alterations in the intestinal microbiota may play a role in the pathogenesis of functional bowel disorders (FBDs). Probiotics are widely used to improve intestinal dysbacteriosis in FBDs. In the context of FBDs, washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) appear to be a promising therapeutic option. We aimed to compare probiotics with WMT by using a propensity-score matching analysis (PSMA). Methods: We conducted a retrospective investigation of 103 patients with FBDs, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional constipation (FC), functional diarrhea (FDr), functional abdominal bloating (FAB). Patients were divided into the WMT group or probiotics group (taking probiotics capsules). Data on the following parameters were matched for PSMA: age; sex; disease course; body mass index; anxiety; insomnia; tobacco smoking; alcohol consumption; and levels of D-lactate, diamine oxidase, and lipopolysaccharide. Intestinal barrier function (IBF) and symptoms were evaluated both before and after treatment initiation. Prognostic factors were assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: PSMA identified in 34 matched pairs (11 IBS, 12 FC, 7 FDr, and 4 FAB in the probiotics group and 14 IBS, 13 FC, 5 FDr, and 2 FAB in the WMT group. Improvement of FBD symptoms was greater with WMT than probiotics (P = 0.002). The WMT group had significantly fewer patients with intestinal barrier damage than the probiotics group (38.2% vs. 67.6%, P = 0.041). This improvement of FBD with WMT was further reflected as a reduction in D-lactate levels (P = 0.031). Increased D-lactate levels which were identified as a prognostic factor for FBDs (HR = 0.248, 95%CI 0.093–0.666, P = 0.006) in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Conclusion: WMT could improve symptoms and IBF in patients with FBDs. Increased D-lactate levels in patients with FBDs may predict a favorable response to WMT treatment. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To evaluate if berberine can act on vitamin D receptors (VDR) and thereby regulate the expression of tight junction proteins (TJPs) in irritable bowel syndrame-diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) rats. Methods: The newborn rats were induced into IBS-D rat model via neonatal maternal separation combined with acetic acid chemical stimulation. After modeling, the model was evaluated and rats were divided into the control group and berberine treatment groups (0.85, 1.7 and 3.4 mg/kg, once a day for 2 weeks). The distal colon was obtained and colonic epithelial cells (CECs) were isolated and cultured after IBS-D model evaluation. The vitamin D receptor response element (VDRE) reporter gene was determined in the CECs of IBS-D rats to analyze the effect of berberine on the VDRE promoter. VDR overexpression or silencing technology was used to analyze whether VDR plays a role in promoting intestinal barrier repair, and to determine which region of VDR plays a role in berberine-regulated intestinal TJPs. Results: The IBS-D rat model was successfully constructed and the symptoms were improved by berberine in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). The activity of VDRE promoter was also effectively promoted by berberine (P<0.05). Berberine increased the expression of TJPs in IBS-D CECs (P<0.05). VDR expression was significantly increased after transfection of different domains of VDR when compared to normal control and basic plasmid groups (all P<0.05). RT-qPCR and Western blot results showed that compared with the blank group, expressions of occludin and zonula occludens-1 were significantly higher in VDR containing groups (all P<0.05). Berberine plus pCMV-Myc-VDR-N group exerted the highest expression levels of occludin and zonula occludens-1 (P<0.05). Conclusion: Berberine enhances intestinal mucosal barrier function of IBS-D rats by promoting VDR activity, and the main site of action is the N-terminal region of VDR. © 2023, The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder. Traditionally, early life stress (ELS) is predisposed to IBS in adult. However, whether ELS induces IBS in early life remains unclear. Methods: Separated cohort studies were conducted in neonatal male pups of C57BL/6 mice by maternal separation (MS) model. MS and non-separation mice were scheduled to be evaluated for prime IBS-phenotypes, including visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal motility, intestinal permeability, and anxiety-like behavior. Ileal contents and fecal samples were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bacterial community analyses. Subcellular structures of intestinal epithelial, such as epithelial tight junctions and mitochondria, were observed under transmission electron microscopy. Results: MS induced visceral hypersensitivity and decreased total intestinal transit time from childhood to adulthood. In addition, MS induced intestinal hyperpermeability and anxiety-like behavior from adolescence to adulthood. Besides, MS affected intestinal microbial composition from childhood to adulthood. Moreover, MS disrupted intestinal mitochondrial structure from childhood to adulthood. Conclusion: The study showed for the first time that MS induced IBS from early life to adulthood in mice. The disrupted intestinal mitochondrial structure and the significant dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota in early life may contribute to the initiation and progress of IBS from early life to adulthood.

AB  - Background: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often show psychological disorders, including somatization, usually driven by an altered gut–brain axis. These changes are also accompanied by modifications in the circulating levels of vitamin D (VD) and neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and circulating levels of VD, 5-HT, and BDNF in IBS patients with diarrhea (IBS-D) categorized according to somatization. Methods: Fifty-three IBS-D patients were recruited and profiled for GI symptoms by validated questionnaires. The fasting serum concentrations of VD, 5-HT, and BDNF were assessed. The health of the intestinal barrier, minimal inflammation, and dysbiosis was also evaluated. Key Results: Thirty patients showed high somatization scores, IBS-D(S+), and 23 low somatization scores, IBS-D(S-). IBS-D(S+) patients reported higher “Abdominal pain” and the “Abdominal pain duration in days” scores, lower serum VD levels and increased 5-HT and BDNF concentrations than IBS-D(S-). Besides, in IBS-D(S+) patients, the GI symptoms correlated with 5HT, BDNF, and VD concentrations. These parameters were associated with impaired small intestinal permeability and increased inflammation markers. Conclusions and Inferences: These data support the multifactorial IBS pathogenesis in which organic and psychological factors interact. An active role by VD, 5-HT, and BDNF in affecting the clinical and biochemical profiles in IBS-D(S+) patients may be conceivable. Therefore, the routine VD estimation and the assay of circulating levels of 5-HT and BDNF could be considered a new approach for managing these patients. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether electroacupuncture (EA) maintains intestinal homeostasis in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) rats by repairing intestinal barrier function through enteric glial cell (EGC)-derived S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into a control group (n = 10) and an IBS-D group (n = 20). These rats received senna solution by gavage and chronic unpredictable mild stress for 14 days and were further divided into a model group (n = 10) and an EA group (n = 10). Rats in the EA group were electroacupunctured at ST25 (Tianshu), ST36 (Zusanli), and LR3 (Taichong) for 20 min every day for 14 days. The abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR), the percentage of time spent in open arms (OT%) in the elevated plus maze test, and the diarrhea index (DI) were measured. Histopathological examination was performed to evaluate the pathological features of the colon after sacrificing the rats. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the EGC in the muscle and submucosal layers. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect GSNO expression in the colon. Double immunofluorescence labeling was used to detect the colocalized GFAP and GSNO expressions in the muscle and submucosal layers. Plasma FITC-dextran was used to measure intestinal permeability, whereas western blot was used to detect ZO-1 and occludin expressions in the colon. Results: OT% and ZO-1 and occludin expressions were significantly lower than those of the control group, whereas AWR scores, DI, GSNO expression in the colon, colocalized GFAP and GSNO expressions in the submucosal layer, and intestinal permeability were significantly higher than those of the control group. Structural EGC abnormalities were observed in the model group. After EA treatment, OT% and ZO-1 and occludin expressions increased significantly, whereas AWR scores, DI, GSNO expression, colocalized GFAP and GSNO expressions in the submucosal layer, and intestinal permeability decreased significantly. The EGC structure was then restored to its normal state. Conclusion: EA treatment downregulates the submucosal EGC–derived GSNO expressions, repairs the intestinal barrier by upregulating the ZO-1 and occludin expression, and improves IBS-D symptoms, including visceral hypersensitivity, anxiety, and diarrhea, suggesting a potential role for EGC-derived GSNO in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis in IBS-D rats.

AB  - Intestinal proteases mediate digestion and immune signalling, while increased gut proteolytic activity disrupts the intestinal barrier and generates visceral hypersensitivity, which is common in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the mechanisms controlling protease function are unclear. Here we show that members of the gut microbiota suppress intestinal proteolytic activity through production of unconjugated bilirubin. This occurs via microbial β-glucuronidase-mediated conversion of bilirubin conjugates. Metagenomic analysis of faecal samples from patients with post-infection IBS (n = 52) revealed an altered gut microbiota composition, in particular a reduction in Alistipes taxa, and high gut proteolytic activity driven by specific host serine proteases compared with controls. Germ-free mice showed 10-fold higher proteolytic activity compared with conventional mice. Colonization with microbiota samples from high proteolytic activity IBS patients failed to suppress proteolytic activity in germ-free mice, but suppression of proteolytic activity was achieved with colonization using microbiota from healthy donors. High proteolytic activity mice had higher intestinal permeability, a higher relative abundance of Bacteroides and a reduction in Alistipes taxa compared with low proteolytic activity mice. High proteolytic activity IBS patients had lower fecal β-glucuronidase activity and end-products of bilirubin deconjugation. Mice treated with unconjugated bilirubin and β-glucuronidase-overexpressing E. coli significantly reduced proteolytic activity, while inhibitors of microbial β-glucuronidases increased proteolytic activity. Together, these data define a disease-relevant mechanism of host–microbial interaction that maintains protease homoeostasis in the gut. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT5716, a probiotic strain isolated from human milk, has reported beneficial effects on different gastrointestinal disorders. Moreover, it has shown its ability to restore altered immune responses, in association with microbiome modulation in different pathological conditions. Therefore, our aim was to assess the effects of a Limosilacbacillus fermentum CECT5716 in a rat experimental model of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that resembles human IBS. The experimental IBS was induced by deoxycholic acid (DCA) in rats and then, Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 (109 CFU/day/rat) was administered. Behavioral studies, hyperalgesia and intestinal hypersensitivity determinations were performed and the impact of the probiotic on the inflammatory and intestinal barrier integrity was evaluated. Additionally, the gut microbiota composition was analyzed. Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 attenuated the anxiety-like behavior as well as the visceral hypersensitivity and referred pain. Moreover, this probiotic ameliorated the gut inflammatory status, re-establishing the altered intestinal permeability, reducing the mast cell degranulation and re-establishing the gut dysbiosis in experimental IBS. Therefore, our results suggest a potential use of Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 in clinical practice for the management of IBS patients. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Enteric glial cells are emerging as critical players in the regulation of intestinal motility, secretion, epithelial barrier function, and gut homeostasis in health and disease. Enteric glia react to intestinal inflammation by converting to a ‘reactive glial phenotype’ and enteric gliosis, contributing to neuroinflammation, enteric neuropathy, bowel motor dysfunction and dysmotility, diarrhea or constipation, ‘leaky gut’, and visceral pain. The focus of the minireview is on the impact of inflammation on enteric glia reactivity in response to diverse insults such as intestinal surgery, ischemia, infections (C. difficile infection, HIV-Tat-induced diarrhea, endotoxemia and paralytic ileus), GI diseases (inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticular disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, colorectal cancer) and functional GI disorders (postoperative ileus, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome). Significant progress has been made in recent years on molecular pathogenic mechanisms of glial reactivity and enteric gliosis, resulting in enteric neuropathy, disruption of motility, diarrhea, visceral hypersensitivity and abdominal pain. There is a growing number of glial molecular targets with therapeutic implications that includes receptors for interleukin-1 (IL-1R), purines (P2X2R, A2BR), PPARα, lysophosphatidic acid (LPAR1), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4R), estrogen-β receptor (ERβ) adrenergic α-2 (α-2R) and endothelin B (ETBR), connexin-43 / Colony-stimulating factor 1 signaling (Cx43/CSF1) and the S100β/RAGE signaling pathway. These exciting new developments are the subject of the minireview. Some of the findings in pre-clinical models may be translatable to humans, raising the possibility of designing future clinical trials to test therapeutic application(s). Overall, research on enteric glia has resulted in significant advances in our understanding of GI pathophysiology. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Changes in microbiome composition are associated with a wide array of human diseases, turning the human microbiota into an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Yet, clinical translation of these findings requires the establishment of causative connections between specific microbial taxa and their functional impact on host tissues. Here, we infuse gut organ cultures with longitudinal microbiota samples collected from therapy-naive patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) under a low-fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet. We show that post-diet microbiota regulates intestinal expression of inflammatory and neuro-muscular gene sets. Specifically, we identify Bifidobacterium adolescentis as a diet-sensitive pathobiont that alters tight junction integrity and disrupts gut barrier functions. Collectively, we present a pathway discovery platform for mechanistic dissection and identification of functional diet-host-microbiota modules. Our data support the hypothesis that the gut microbiota mediates the beneficial effects of a low-FODMAP diet and reinforce the potential feasibility of microbiome-based therapies in IBS. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Tongxie Yaofang (TXYF), a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with four components as follows: Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (baizhu), Radix Paeoniae Alba (baishao), Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (chenpi) and Radix Saposhnikovia Divaricata (fangfeng), benefits irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nonetheless, proofs of this formula ameliorating D-IBS and T2DM are required. This research aimed at investigating the efficacy of TXYF in treating inflammation in rats with D-IBS and T2DM using animal models. In this study, gavage with high-fat diet, fasciculation, and senna was given to develop rat models with target diseases. To determine intestinal inflammations, major inflammatory factors, and intestinal permeability proteins, H&E staining, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry methods were employed, respectively. This study also utilized Western blot to discover potential inflammatory targets. Results of this research illustrates that TXYF treatment reduced the level of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and raised the IL-10 concentration in liver-depressed spleende ficient rats with D-IBS and T2DM, indicating controlled inflammatory reactions. Staining analysis also showed improved disease states of animal models. Furthermore, efficient rebounds of claudin-1, an intestinal permeability-associated protein, were detected. Moreover, TXYF may treat D-IBS and T2DM in rats via the rage pathway. Copyright © 2022 Xu, Zhang, Lu, Li, Li and Tao.

AB  - BACKGROUND Chronic abdominal pain is the most common cause for gastroenterology consultation and is frequently associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. These disorders present similar brain/gut/microbiota trialogue alterations, associated with abnormal intestinal permeability, intestinal dysbiosis and colonic hypersensitivity (CHS). Intestinal dysbiosis can alter colon homeostasis leading to abnormal activation of the innate immunity that promotes CHS, perhaps involving the toll-like receptors (TLRs), which play a central role in innate immunity. AIM To understand the mechanisms between early life event paradigm on intestinal permeability, fecal microbiota composition and CHS development in mice with TLRs expression in colonocytes. METHODS Maternal separation model (NMS) CHS model, which mimics deleterious events in childhood that can induce a wide range of chronic disorders during adulthood were used. Colonic sensitivity of NMS mice was evaluated by colorectal distension (CRD) coupled with intracolonic pressure variation (IPV) measurement. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing from weaning to CRD periods. TLR mRNA expression was evaluated in colonocytes. Additionally, the effect of acute intrarectal instillation of the TLR5 agonist flagellin (FliC) on CHS in adult naive wildtype mice was analyzed. RESULTS Around 50% of NMS mice exhibited increased intestinal permeability and CHS associated with intestinal dysbiosis, characterized by a significant decrease of species richness, an alteration of the core fecal microbiota and a specific increased relative abundance of flagellated bacteria. Only TLR5 mRNA expression was increased in colonocytes of NMS mice with CHS. Acute intrarectal instillation of FliC induced transient increase of IPV, reflecting transient CHS appearance. CONCLUSION Altogether, these data suggest a pathophysiological continuum between intestinal dysbiosis and CHS, with a role for TLR5. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Overweight and obesity have been suggested as significant factors in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) development. However, the relationship between overweight/obesity and IBS is unclear. It is known that a modified intestinal barrier, especially the permeability of the small intestine (s-IP), can play a significant role in the pathogenesis of both obesity and IBS. Moreover, dietary interventions are essential for treating both pathologies. We evaluated the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the urinary and circulating markers of GI barrier function and integrity, the markers of intestinal dysbiosis and bacterial translocation, in 40 IBS patients with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) (32 females and 8 males; mean age = 43.5 ± 1.4 years), categorized using their Body Mass Index levels as normal (NW) and overweight (OW). Evaluations were performed before and after 12 weeks of a Low FODMAP Diet (LFD). At the baseline, OW patients showed a significantly higher s-IP than NW. After an LFD, a significant improvement of s-IP in OW patients occurred, along with a significant decrease in markers of epithelial integrity and bacterial translocation. Our findings highlight the close relationship between overweight and the intestinal barrier and support their involvement in IBS-D pathophysiology. Furthermore, the positive role of an LFD in managing overweight IBS-D was highlighted. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder whose pathogenesis is considered multifactorial, including abnormal gut motility, visceral hyperreactivity, psychological factors, disturbances in the brain-gut axis, leaky gut, oxidative stress, etc. We aimed to investigate serum levels of specific immunoglobulin E and G to common food antigens and zonulin and to assess their use in clinical practice for patients with IBS. Material and methods. We included 23 participants, 15 with IBS (diagnosed according to the Rome IV criteria) and 8 healthy controls. We investigated serum levels of specific IgG antibodies to 24 food antigens, specific IgE antibodies to 20 food antigens, anti-celiac antibodies, fecal calprotectin and serum zonulin by ELISA. Results. Food-specific positive IgG antibodies were significantly higher in patients with IBS than in controls (p = 0.007). IgE-mediated allergic reactions were found in five patients with IBS; no one had anti-TG antibodies. One-third of IBS patients demonstrated a low degree of chronic inflammation (positive fecal calprotectin test > 50 ng/mL) without specific bacterial infection. Serum levels of zonulin in IBS patients were higher than in healthy controls (0.378 ± 0.13 vs. 0.250 ± 0.14 ng/mL, p = 0.0315). However, no correlations between clinical symptoms and zonulin levels were found. Conclusion. The mechanisms of IgG hypersensitivity and low degree inflammation in IBS and elevated zonulin may contribute to multifactor pathogenesis in IBS. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most frequent and debilitating conditions leading to gastroenterological referrals. However, recommended treatments remain limited, yielding only limited therapeutic gains. Chitin-glucan (CG) is a novel dietary prebiotic classically used in humans at a dosage of 1.5-3.0 g/d and is considered a safe food ingredient by the European Food Safety Authority. To provide an alternative approach to managing patients with IBS, we performed preclinical molecular, cellular, and animal studies to evaluate the role of chitin-glucan in the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in IBS. AIM To evaluate the roles of CG in visceral analgesia, intestinal inflammation, barrier function, and to develop computational molecular models. METHODS Visceral pain was recorded through colorectal distension (CRD) in a model of long-lasting colon hypersensitivity induced by an intra-rectal administration of TNBS [15 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)] in 33 Sprague-Dawley rats. Intracolonic pressure was regularly assessed during the 9 wk-experiment (weeks 0, 3, 5, and 7) in animals receiving CG (n = 14) at a human equivalent dose (HED) of 1.5 g/d or 3.0 g/d and compared to negative control (tap water, n = 11) and positive control (phloroglucinol at 1.5 g/d HED, n = 8) groups. The anti-inflammatory effect of CG was evaluated using clinical and histological scores in 30 C57bl6 male mice with colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administered in their drinking water during 14 d. HT-29 cells under basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with CG to evaluate changes in pathways related to analgesia (µ-opioid receptor (MOR), cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, inflammation [interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1b, and IL-8] and barrier function [mucin 2-5AC, claudin-2, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2] using the real-time PCR method. Molecular modelling of CG, LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and phospholipomannan (PLM) was developed, and the ability of CG to chelate microbial pathogenic lipids was evaluated by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM. RESULTS Daily CG orally-administered to rats or mice was well tolerated without including diarrhea, visceral hypersensitivity, or inflammation, as evaluated at histological and molecular levels. In a model of CRD, CG at a dosage of 3 g/d HED significantly decreased visceral pain perception by 14% after 2 wk of administration (P < 0.01) and reduced inflammation intensity by 50%, resulting in complete regeneration of the colonic mucosa in mice with DSS-induced colitis. To better reproduce the characteristics of visceral pain in patients with IBS, we then measured the therapeutic impact of CG in rats with TNBS-induced inflammation to long-lasting visceral hypersensitivity. CG at a dosage of 1.5 g/d HED decreased visceral pain perception by 20% five weeks after colitis induction (P < 0.01). When the CG dosage was increased to 3.0 g/d HED, this analgesic effect surpassed that of the spasmolytic agent phloroglucinol, manifesting more rapidly within 3 wk and leading to a 50% inhibition of pain perception (P < 0.0001). The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of CG involved, at least in part, a significant induction of MOR, CB2 receptor, and IL-10, as well as a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-8. CG also significantly upregulated barrier-related genes including muc5AC, claudin-2, and ZO-2. Molecular modelling of CG revealed a new property of the molecule as a chelator of microbial pathogenic lipids, sequestering gram-negative LPS and gram-positive LTA bacterial toxins, as well as PLM in fungi at the lowesr energy conformations. CONCLUSION CG decreased visceral perception and intestinal inflammation through master gene regulation and direct binding of microbial products, suggesting that CG may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for patients with IBS or IBS-like symptoms. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Individuals with suspected non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) often report better tolerance of spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta) compared to wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum) bakery products. This experience has neither been validated nor explained on a molecular level. Therefore, we performed blinded wheat and spelt bread challenge in this patient group. Twenty-four adults with a history of NCWS but suspected spelt tolerance were challenged in a single-blinded crossover design over six weeks with six different study breads each at 300 g per day for 4 days followed by a washout phase of 3 days. Study breads comprised spelt and wheat breads made either after a traditional (T) or a current (C) recipe, resulting in four bread types plus a gluten-free bread with 1.5% added oligosaccharides (+FODMAP) and a gluten-free bread with 5% added wheat gluten (+Gluten). The main outcome parameter was the Irritable Bowel Syndrome—Severity Scoring System, which was higher than self-estimated by the participants after spelt bread consumption (p = 0.002 for T; p = 0.028 for C) and lower for wheat bread (p = 0.052 for T; p = 0.007 for C), resulting in no difference between wheat and spelt bread tolerance. The +FODMAP bread was better tolerated than both T breads (p = 0.003 for spelt; p = 0.068 for wheat) and equally well tolerated as both C breads and +Gluten breads after normalization to the washout scores. Neither signs of inflammation nor markers for intestinal barrier integrity were influenced. Our data do not confirm, on an objective basis, the differences in expected symptoms resulting from wheat and spelt products, suggesting a strong nocebo effect for wheat and a placebo effect for spelt. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered defecation, usually accompanied by abdominal bloating or distension. The integrated model of bidirectional interaction between the central, autonomic, enteric nervous system, the microbiome, and the gut barrier allows a better understanding of the pathophysiology of IBS, as well as consideration of potential therapeutic strategies. IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) represents a therapeutic challenge. Dietary changes or restrictions are most commonly used by patients in an attempt at symptom control. Therefore, a number of diets, especially low-FODMAP diet, have increasingly gained interest as a therapy for IBS-D or mixed IBS. However, this kind of diet, while effective, is not exempt of problems. It is therefore necessary that other therapeutic options be considered while bearing pathophysiological mechanisms and general symptom management in mind.

AB  - Objective: There is no conclusive evidence for involvement of intestinal barrier alteration in the etiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). The aims of this pilot study were to identify serum markers of intestinal barrier integrity in patients with AN and to determine the relationships between those markers and body mass index (BMI), eating disorder symptoms, gastrointestinal complaints, and liver synthesis function (international normalized ratio [INR]). Method: Twenty-five outpatients with AN prior to starting treatment and 28 healthy controls (HC) were assessed. BMI and serum markers of intestinal barrier integrity were measured, including zonulin family peptides (ZFP), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and intestinal fatty-acid-binding protein (i-FABP). Eating disorder symptoms and gastrointestinal complaints were evaluated via questionnaires. Results: The serum ZFP concentration was significantly lower in patients with AN than in HC (44.2 [7.4] vs. 49.2 [5.6] ng/ml, mean [standard deviation], p =.008). LBP and i-FABP did not differ between the two groups. In patients with AN, serum ZFP was significantly predicted by BMI (β = 0.479, p =.009), age (β = 0.411, p =.020), and INR (β = −0.388, p =.028). No such associations were found for either gastrointestinal complaints or eating disorder symptoms. Discussion: Abnormal levels of serum ZFP were observed in patients with AN. Further studies with other assessment methods are warranted to examine intestinal barrier function in AN. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02745067. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background/Aim: Diabetes has substantive co-occurrence with disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBIs). The pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms linking diabetes and DGBIs are unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of diabetes and gut dysmotility. We investigated whether impaired gut barrier function is regulated by a key miRNA, miR-10b-5p, linking diabetes and gut dysmotility. Methods: We created a new mouse line using the Mb3Cas12a/Mb3Cpf1 endonuclease to delete mir-10b globally. Loss of function studies in the mir-10b knockout (KO) mice were conducted to characterize diabetes, gut dysmotility, and gut barrier dysfunction phenotypes in these mice. Gain of function studies were conducted by injecting these mir-10b KO mice with a miR-10b-5p mimic. Further, we performed miRNA-sequencing analysis from colonic mucosa from mir-10b KO, wild type, and miR-10b-5p mimic injected mice to confirm (1) deficiency of miR-10b-5p in KO mice, and (2) restoration of miR-10b-5p after the mimic injection. Results: Congenital loss of mir-10b in mice led to the development of hyperglycemia, gut dysmotility, and gut barrier dysfunction. Gut permeability was increased, but expression of the tight junction protein Zonula occludens-1 was reduced in the colon of mir-10b KO mice. Patients with diabetes or constipation- predominant irritable bowel syndrome, a known DGBI that is linked to leaky gut, had significantly reduced miR-10b-5p expression. Injection of a miR-10b-5p mimic in mir-10b KO mice rescued these molecular alterations and phenotypes. Conclusions: Our study uncovered a potential pathophysiologic mechanism of gut barrier dysfunction that links both the diabetes and gut dysmotility phenotypes in mice lacking miR-10b-5p. Treatment with a miR-10b-5p mimic reversed the leaky gut, diabetic, and gut dysmotility phenotypes, highlighting the translational potential of the miR-10b-5p mimic. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common functional gastrointestinal disease. Besides, baizhu shaoyao decoction (BSD) is an effective treatment for IBS-D; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Purpose: This study aims to assess the ability of BSD to therapy IBS-D and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Methods: First, comprehensive analyses, including ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) screening, Venn analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, and network construction, were performed to characterize IBS-D-related pathways and explore the synergistic effects of BSD active compounds. Next, an IBS-D model was constructed using a three-factor superposition method of neonatal maternal separation, chronic immobilization stress stimulation, and Sennae folium aqueous extract lavage. Moreover, the impact of BSD was assessed based on the body weight, fecal water content, and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR), and the results of the open field test, sucrose preference test, intestinal permeability assessment, transmission electron microscopy, and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) analysis. The factors that regulate the BSD effects on IBS-D were estimated using immunoblotting, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RTPCR), immunohistochemistry, and transcriptome sequencing analyses. Results: We found that BSD improved depressive behavior, brain–gut peptide levels, and intestinal permeability induced by IBS-D by increasing the abundance of intestinal tight junctions. In addition, BSD reduced secretory immunoglobulin A levels and the number of intestinal mast cells in IBS-D rats. Network pharmacology and transcriptome sequencing analysis further revealed that the forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling pathway contributed to the BSD-induced alleviation of IBS-D, as BSD regulated the protein and mRNA levels of FoxO1, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and FoxO3a. Importantly, a FoxO1 inhibitor effectively alleviated IBS-D symptoms in rats, whereas a FoxO3a agonist had the opposite effects. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that BSD alleviates depression and intestinal symptoms by regulating brain–gut peptide expression and restoring the intestinal barrier function via the FoxO signaling pathway. Furthermore, our study uses serum pharmacochemistry technology to analyze the in vivo components of TCM formula under effective condition, solving the problem of the discovery of the effective components of TCM to some extent. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) displays chronic abdominal pain with altered defecation. Most of the patients develop visceral hypersensitivity possibly resulting from impaired gut barrier and altered gut microbiota. We previously demonstrated that colonic hyperpermeability with visceral hypersensitivity in animal IBS models, which is mediated via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)–Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–proinflammatory cytokine signaling. CRF impairs gut barrier via TLR4. Leaky gut induces bacterial translocation resulting in dysbiosis, and increases lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of TLR4 by LPS increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which activate visceral sensory neurons to induce visceral hypersensitivity. LPS also activates CRF receptors to further increase gut permeability. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, and recently several researchers suggested the possibility that impaired gut barrier and dysbiosis with low-grade systemic inflammation are involved in MS. Moreover, TLR4–proinflammatory cytokine contributes to the development of insulin resistance and obesity. Thus, the existence of pathophysiological commonality between IBS and MS is expected. This review discusses the potential mechanisms of IBS and MS with reference to gut barrier and microbiota, and explores the possibility of existence of a pathophysiological link between these diseases with a focus on CRF, TLR4, and proinflammatory cytokine signaling. We also review epidemiological data supporting this possibility, and discuss the potential of therapeutic application of the drugs used for MS to IBS treatment. This notion may pave the way for exploring novel therapeutic approaches for these disorders. © 2022 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

AB  - Opioid-dependent immune-mediated analgesic effects have been broadly reported upon inflammation. In preclinical mouse models of intestinal inflammatory diseases, the local release of enkephalins (endogenous opioids) by colitogenic T lymphocytes alleviate inflammation-induced pain by down-modulating gut-innervating nociceptor activation in periphery. In this study, we wondered whether this immune cell-derived enkephalin-mediated regulation of the nociceptor activity also operates under steady state conditions. Here, we show that chimeric mice engrafted with enkephalin-deficient bone marrow cells exhibit not only visceral hypersensitivity but also an increase in both epithelial paracellular and transcellular permeability, an alteration of the microbial topography resulting in increased bacteria-epithelium interactions and a higher frequency of IgA-producing plasma cells in Peyer’s patches. All these alterations of the intestinal homeostasis are associated with an anxiety-like behavior despite the absence of an overt inflammation as observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, our results show that immune cell-derived enkephalins play a pivotal role in maintaining gut homeostasis and normal behavior in mice. Because a defect in the mucosal opioid system remarkably mimics some major clinical symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome, its identification might help to stratify subgroups of patients. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Mast cell (MC) plays a central role in intestinal permeability; however, few MC-targeting drugs are currently available for protection of the intestinal barrier in clinical practice. A nonfluorinated Lidocaine analog 2-diethylamino-N-2,5-dimethylphenyl acetamide (JM25-1) displays anti-allergic effect, but its impact on MC remains elusive. In this study, we explored whether JM25-1 has therapeutic potential on intestinal barrier defect through stabilizing MC. JM25-1 alleviated release of β-hexosaminidase and cytokine production of MC. The paracellular permeability was redressed by JM25-1 in intestinal epithelial cell monolayers co-cultured with activated MC. In vivo, JM25-1 diminished intestinal mucosal MC amount and cytokine production, especially downregulating the expression of CRHR1, accompanied by an increase of CRHR2. Protective effects appeared in JM25-1-treated stress rats with a recovery of weight and intestinal barrier integrity. Through network pharmacology analysis, JM25-1 showed a therapeutic possibility for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predictive targeting on PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. As expected, JM25-1 reinforced p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR signaling in MC, while the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin reversed the action of JM25-1 on the expression of CRHR1 and CRHR2. Moreover, JM25-1 successfully remedied intestinal defect and declined MC and CRHR1 expression in rat colon caused by colonic mucus of IBS patients. Our data implied that JM25-1 possessed therapeutic capacity against intestinal barrier defects by targeting the CRH receptors of MC through PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Paeoniflorin has been traditionally used to treat pain and immunologic derangement in China. However, its detailed mechanism remains to be illuminated. We investigated the mechanism by which paeoniflorin alleviates the inflammatory response in a mouse model of irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D). C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and miR-29a knockout (KO) mice were randomly divided into control, model, rifaximin, and paeoniflorin groups (n = 7). IBS-D model was induced by single intracolonic instillation of 0.1 mL trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS, 50 mg/mL) combined with restraint stress for seven consecutive days. The treatment groups received rifaximin (100 mg/kg) and paeoniflorin (50 mg/kg) via intragastric administration for seven days, respectively. The results showed that the fecal water content, fecal pellet output, visceral sensitivity, and histopathological score after paeoniflorin treatment were lower than those of the model group in both WT and miR-29a KO mice (P < 0.05). In both lineage mice, damage was observed in the colon tissues of model group, while paeoniflorin treatment partially ameliorated the tissue damage. Serum levels of DAO, DLA, IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, and MPO were decreased after paeoniflorin treatment (P < 0.05), with miR-29a KO mice in a lower level compared with that of WT mice. RT-PCR showed that the relative expression of miR-29a, NF-κB (p65), NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α was downregulated while NKRF was upregulated after paeoniflorin treatment (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that intestinal epithelial protein levels of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 decreased while those of Claudin-1 and ZO-1 increased in the paeoniflorin treatment group (P < 0.05). In general, compared with WT mice, NLRP3 inflammasome pathway targets was in much lower expression level than miR-29a KO mice. In conclusion, paeoniflorin could inhibit abnormal activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway by inhibiting miR-29a in IBS-D, thereby relieving the inflammatory response of the intestinal mucosa and reconstructing the intestinal epithelial barrier. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Brain oxytocin plays a role in gastrointestinal functions. Among them, oxytocin acts centrally to modulate gastrointestinal motility and visceral sensation. Intestinal barrier function, one of important gut functions, is also regulated by the central nervous system. Little is, however, known about a role of central oxytocin in the regulation of intestinal barrier function. The present study was performed to clarify whether brain oxytocin is also involved in regulation of intestinal barrier function and its mechanism. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in rats. Intracisternal injection of oxytocin dose-dependently abolished increased colonic permeability in response to lipopolysaccharide while intraperitoneal injection of oxytocin at the same dose failed to block it. Either atropine or surgical vagotomy blocked the central oxytocin-induced improvement of colonic hyperpermeability. Cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist but not adenosine or opioid receptor antagonist prevented the central oxytocin-induced blockade of colonic hyperpermeability. In addition, intracisternal injection of oxytocin receptor antagonist blocked the ghrelin- or orexin-induced improvement of intestinal barrier function. These results suggest that oxytocin acts centrally in the brain to reduce colonic hyperpermeability. The vagal cholinergic pathway or cannabinoid 1 receptor signaling plays a vital role in the process. The oxytocin-induced improvement of colonic hyperpermeability mediates the central ghrelin- or orexin-induced improvement of intestinal barrier function. We would therefore suggest that activation of central oxytocin signaling may be useful for leaky gut-related diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and autism. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We sought to explore the protective effect of the combination of fenchone (FE) and sodium hyaluronate (SH) on ice water-induced IBS-C rats and the potential mechanism. The neurotransmitter levels, including substance P (SP), motilin (MTL), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), were determined by ELISA methods. The stem cell factors (SCF)/c-Kit signaling pathway-related protein and mRNA levels were determined by western blot and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses, respectively. The expressions of tight ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 were also measured by western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining. The 16S rRNA gene sequence was used to measure the composition of gut microbiota. The co-administration of FE and SH improved the body weight, number of fecal pellets, fecal moisture, abdominal with drawal reflex score, and gastrointestinal transit rate in IBS-C rats. The unique efficacy of combination depended on the regulation of balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, enhancement of intestinal barrier function, and activation of SCF/c-Kit pathway. The gut microbiota structure was also restored. The ability of FE combined with SH to regulate SCF/c-Kit signaling pathway, enhance intestinal barrier function, and modulate gut microbiota contributes to their efficacy in managing IBS-C in rats. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Leaky gut, an altered intestinal barrier function, has been described in many diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We have recently demonstrated that orexin in the brain blocked leaky gut in rats, suggesting that the brain plays a role in regulation of intestinal barrier function. In the present study, we tried to clarify whether GLP-1 acts centrally in the brain to regulate intestinal barrier function and its mechanism. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in rats. Intracisternal injection of GLP-1 analogue, liraglutide dose-dependently abolished increased colonic permeability in response to lipopolysaccharide. Either atropine or surgical vagotomy blocked the central GLP-1-induced improvement of colonic hyperpermeability. Intracisternal GLP-1 receptor antagonist, exendin (9–39) prevented the central GLP-1-induced blockade of colonic hyperpermeability. In addition, intracisternal injection of orexin receptor antagonist, SB-334867 blocked the GLP-1-induced improvement of intestinal barrier function. On the other hand, subcutaneous liraglutide also improved leaky gut but larger doses of liraglutide were needed to block it. In addition, neither atropine nor vagotomy blocked subcutaneous liraglutide-induced improvement of leaky gut, suggesting that central or peripheral GLP-1 system works separately to improve leaky gut in a vagal-dependent or independent manner, respectively. These results suggest that GLP-1 acts centrally in the brain to reduce colonic hyperpermeability. Brain orexin signaling and the vagal cholinergic pathway play a vital role in the process. We would therefore suggest that activation of central GLP-1 signaling may be useful for leaky gut-related diseases such as IBS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Previous in vitro studies have shown that the intestinal luminal content, including metabolites, possibly regulates epithelial layer responses to harmful stimuli and promotes disease. Therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that fecal supernatants from patients with colon cancer (CC), ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) contain distinct metabolite profiles and establish their effects on Caco-2 cells and human-derived colon organoids (colonoids). The metabolite profiles of fecal supernatants were analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and distinguished patients with CC (n = 6), UC (n = 6), IBS (n = 6) and healthy subjects (n = 6). Caco-2 monolayers and human apical-out colonoids underwent stimulation with fecal supernatants from different patient groups and healthy subjects. Their addition did not impair monolayer integrity, as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance; however, fecal supernatants from different patient groups and healthy subjects altered the gene expression of Caco-2 monolayers, as well as colonoid cultures. In conclusion, the stimulation of Caco-2 cells and colonoids with fecal supernatants derived from CC, UC and IBS patients altered gene expression profiles, potentially reflecting the luminal microenvironment of the fecal sample donor. This experimental approach allows for investigating the crosstalk at the gut barrier and the effects of the gut microenvironment in the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - While gut microbiome and host gene regulation independently contribute to gastrointestinal disorders, it is unclear how the two may interact to influence host pathophysiology. Here we developed a machine learning-based framework to jointly analyse paired host transcriptomic (n = 208) and gut microbiome (n = 208) profiles from colonic mucosal samples of patients with colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. We identified associations between gut microbes and host genes that depict shared as well as disease-specific patterns. We found that a common set of host genes and pathways implicated in gastrointestinal inflammation, gut barrier protection and energy metabolism are associated with disease-specific gut microbes. Additionally, we also found that mucosal gut microbes that have been implicated in all three diseases, such as Streptococcus, are associated with different host pathways in each disease, suggesting that similar microbes can affect host pathophysiology in a disease-specific manner through regulation of different host genes. Our framework can be applied to other diseases for the identification of host gene–microbiome associations that may influence disease outcomes. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Research has shown that the diet modulates both the gut microbiota and the immune system, establishing a bidirectional communication with signaling pathways or metabolic production, which affects each other s functions. Alterations in the bidirectional signaling of the microbiota-gut-brain triad have been linked in the pathogenesis of brain-gut disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, and the manifestation of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The Mediterranean diet is recognized worldwide as a model of healthy eating and is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality. Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean-type dietary pattern is able to modulate the gut microbiota, increasing its diversity and decreasing intestinal permeability. In addition, it is associated with specific gut microbiota characteristics that help prevent chronic noncommunicable degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Berberine (BR) shows promise as a candidate for treating irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). However, the undesired physicochemical properties and poor oral absorption limit its clinical translation. A ketogenic diet (KD) can induce intestinal overexpression of cannabidiol (CB) receptors, which may offer a potential target for IBS-D-specific delivery of BR. Methods: The microemulsions loaded with BR and decorated with cannabidiol (CBD/BR-MEs) were developed through a one-step emulsion method. The pharmaceutical behaviors of the CBD/BR-MEs were measured using dynamic light scattering and high-performance liquid chromatography. The efficacy of the anti-IBS-D therapy was evaluated by assessing fecal water content, Bristol score, and AWR score. The intestinal permeability were assessed through immunofluorescent staining of CB1 and ZO-1, respectively. The signaling of CREB/BDNF/c-Fos was also studied along with immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical examination of brain sections. Results: The CBD/BR-MEs, which had a particle size of approximately 30 nm and a surface density of 2% (wt%) CBD, achieved greater than 80% (wt%) encapsulation efficiency of BR. The pharmacokinetics performance of CBD/BR-MEs was significantly improved in the KD-fed IBS-D rats than the standard diet-fed ones, which is highly related to intestinal expression of CB1 receptors. The treatment with CBD/BR-MEs and KD exhibited evident comprehensive advantages over the other groups in terms of anti-IBS-D efficacy. CBD/BR-MEs and KD synergistically decreased intestinal permeability. Moreover, the treatment with CBD/BR-MEs and KD not only blocked the CREB/BDNF/c-Fos signaling in the brain but also decreased the levels of neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, and inflammatory cytokines in the serum of IBS-D model rats. Conclusion: Such a design represents the first attempt at IBS-D-targeted drug delivery for improved oral absorption and efficacy through KD-induced target exposure, which holds promising potential for the treatment of IBS-D. © 2023 Fan et al.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two intestinal diseases with different pathological changes. Electroacupuncture (EA) at Zusanli (ST36) on both IBS and UC is widely used in clinic practice. But it is unclear whether acupuncture at one acupoint can treat two different intestinal diseases at different layers of intestinal barrier. To address this question, we explored three intestinal barrier lesions in IBS and UC mice with the aid of transcriptome data analysis and studied the efficacy of EA at ST36 on them. The transcriptome data analysis showed that both UC and IBS had disrupted intestinal barrier in various layers. And both UC and IBS had epithelial barrier lesions with reduction of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1, while UC rather than IBS had the destruction of the mucus barrier with less MUC2 expression. As to the vascular barrier, UC showed a higher CD31 level and mesenteric blood flow reduction, while IBS showed a lower PV-1 level. EA at ST36 can significantly improve the above lesions of intestinal barrier of IBS and UC. Our results gave more details about the comprehensive protective effect of EA for UC and IBS. We guess the effect of acupuncture may be a kind of homeostasis regulation. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by myelin-specific autoreactive T cells. We previously demonstrated intestinal barrier disruption and signs of inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Fecal calprotectin is a disease activity biomarker in inflammatory bowel diseases, released by neutrophils in response to inflammation. We aimed to further investigate EAE manifestations in the gastrointestinal tract and to determine whether calprotectin is a useful biomarker of intestinal inflammation in EAE. Calprotectin was analyzed in feces, cecal contents, and plasma of EAE mice. Infiltrating neutrophils and goblet cells were investigated in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract before the onset of neurological symptoms and during established disease. We found increased calprotectin levels in feces, cecal content, and plasma preceding EAE onset that further escalated during disease progression. Increased neutrophil infiltration in the intestinal tissue concomitant with IL-17 expression and myeloperoxidase activity was found to correlate well with clinical activity. Increased goblet cells in the intestine, similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), were also observed. The results suggest calprotectin as a good biomarker of gastrointestinal inflammation in EAE and the potential of this model as a useful animal model for IBS. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Diarrheal irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), characterized primarily by the presence of diarrhea and abdominal pain, is a clinical manifestation resulting from a multitude of causative factors. Furthermore, Sishen Wan (SSW) has demonstrated efficacy in treating IBS-D. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Methods: A model of IBS-D was induced by a diet containing 45 % lactose and chronic unpredictable mild stress. Additionally, the impact of SSW was assessed by measuring body weight, visceral sensitivity, defecation parameters, intestinal transport velocity, intestinal neurotransmitter levels, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy analysis. Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect the expression of Mucin 2 (MUC2) and Occludin in the colon. Western blotting was used to detect changes in proteins related to tight junction (TJ), autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the colon. Finally, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to monitor the alteration of gut microbiota after SSW treatment. Results: Our study revealed that SSW administration resulted in reduced visceral sensitivity, improved defecation parameters, decreased intestinal transport velocity, and reduced intestinal permeability in IBS-D mice. Furthermore, SSW promotes the secretion of colonic mucus by enhancing autophagy and inhibiting ER stress. SSW treatment caused remodeling of the gut microbiome by increasing the abundance of Blautia, Muribaculum and Ruminococcus torques group. Conclusion: SSW can improve intestinal barrier function by promoting autophagy and inhibiting ER stress, thus exerting a therapeutic effect on IBS-D. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Natural compounds like flavonoids preserve intestinal mucosal integrity through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Additionally, some flavonoids show prebiotic abilities, promoting the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria. This study investigates the protective impact of Lens culinaris extract (LE), which is abundant in flavonoids, on intestinal mucosal integrity during LPS-induced inflammation. Using Caco-2 cells as a model for the intestinal barrier, the study found that LE did not affect cell viability but played a cytoprotective role in the presence of LPS. LE improved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and tight junction (TJ) protein levels, which are crucial for barrier integrity. It also countered the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TRPA1 and TRPV1 induced by LPS and reduced pro-inflammatory markers like TNF-α, NF-κB, IL-1β, and IL-8. Moreover, LE reversed the LPS-induced upregulation of AQP8 and TLR-4 expression. These findings emphasize the potential of natural compounds like LE to regulate the intestinal barrier and reduce inflammation’s harmful effects on intestinal cells. More research is required to understand their mechanisms and explore therapeutic applications, especially for gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: STW 5-II is a combination of six herbal extracts with clinically proven efficacy in functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). STW 5-II contains a wide variety of secondary plant constituents that may interact with the human gut microbiome. In addition to complex carbohydrates, secondary plant metabolites, such as polyphenols, are known to exert prebiotic-like effects. Purpose: This study aimed to assess the bidirectional interactions between STW 5-II and the human gut microbiome. Methods: STW 5-II was incubated with human fecal microbiota in a short-term colonic model. In the samples, the impact of STW 5-II on microbial fermentation capacity (pH, gas production), short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and microbial composition (Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing) was analyzed. In addition, the biotransformation of STW 5-II constituents by the fecal microbiota was assessed by UHPLC[sbnd]HRMS-based metabolite profiling. Furthermore, Caco-2/THP1 co-culture assay was used to explore the effect on gut barrier integrity and inflammatory markers. Results: Fermentation of STW 5-II by fecal microbiota led to consistent changes in pH and gas production and increased production of SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). STW 5-II promoted the enrichment of Bifidobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Eggerthellaceae and suppressed the growth of pathogenic species from the Enterobacteriaceae family. In Caco2/THP1 culture, treatment with STW 5-II-incubated samples resulted in significantly increased transepithelial electrical resistance, indicating enhanced barrier function. Among inflammatory markers, STW 5-II-incubated samples increased LPS-induced secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, as well as NF-κB activity, and significantly decreased the secretion of the pro-inflammatory chemokine MCP-1. UHPLC[sbnd]HRMS analysis identified 110 constituents of STW 5-II with changed levels during incubation with fecal microbiota: 63 constituents that were metabolized, 22 intermittently increased metabolites, and 25 final metabolites, including compounds with established anti-inflammatory activity, such as 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid. Conclusion: These findings indicate a microbiome-mediated digestive health-promoting effect of STW 5-II via three different routes, namely enhanced microbial SCFA production, microbial production of potentially bioactive metabolites from STW 5-II constituents, and prebiotic-like action by promoting the proliferation/growth of beneficial bacteria. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Background and study aims Gastrointestinal adverse reaction to food (GARF) is reported frequently in the general population and even more in patients with disorders of the gut brain axis. However, there is a significant difference between self-reported and objective proven GARF. The aim of the study was to characterize a mucosal correlate of GARF by endoscopic confocal laser endomicroscopy (eCLE) with duodenal food challenge (DFC). Patients and methods In an observational and proof of concept study we evaluated 71 patients with disorders of the gut brain axis without (group I, n=19) and with (group II, n=52) GARF by eCLE and DFC. Spontaneous and food induced transfer of fluorescein into duodenal lumen was detected 10 minutes following intravenously application of fluorescein and 10 minutes after DFC. Results According to Rom IV, the patients (group I/II) could be classified as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 32%/31%, functional abdominal pain without changes in bowel movement 47 %/48 %, functional abdominal bloating/distension 0 %/10 %, functional diarrhea 5 %/ 2 %, and unspecified functional bowel disorder 16 %/10 %, respectively. 21 %/27 % of the patients responded with a fluorescein leakage into the duodenal lumen before and 74 %/69 % following to DFC. Frequency rank order of food components that induced a response were soy (55.5 %/60 %), wheat (60 %/45.5 %), egg (35.7 %/8.3), milk (30 %/18.2 %) and yeast (10 %/6.6 %), respectively. Histology of duodenal biopsies, number, form and distribution of intraepithelial lymphocytes and mucosal mast cells as well as mast cell function were normal. Overall, 14 %/79 % reported main symptom benefit following a food exclusion therapy according to eCLE and DFC that was significant different between the groups. Conclusion The results of our study indicate that eCLE with DFC is a technique to clinically evaluate patients with disorders of the gut brain axis and GARF resulting in a high proportion of patients reporting symptom benefit upon food exclusion dietary advice focussed on the results of eCLE.  © 2024.

AB  - Intestinal barrier dysfunction, a leaky gut, contributes to the pathophysiology of various diseases such as dementia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We recently clarified that orexin, ghrelin, or adenosine A2B signaling in the brain improved leaky gut through the vagus nerve. The present study was performed to clarify whether basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are implicated in the central regulation of intestinal barrier function. We activated BFCNs using benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA), a positive muscarinic M1 allosteric modulator, and evaluated colonic permeability by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in rat colonic tissue. Intracisternal (not intraperitoneal) injection of BQCA blocked the increased colonic permeability in response to lipopolysaccharide. Vagotomy blocked BQCA-induced improvement of colonic hyperpermeability. Intracisternally administered pirenzepine, a muscarinic M1 selective antagonist, prevented intestinal barrier function improvement by intravenously administered 2-deoxy-D-glucose, central vagal stimulant. Adenosine A2B receptor antagonist but not dopamine or opioid receptor antagonist prevented BQCA-induced blockade of colonic hyperpermeability. Additionally, intracisternal injection of pirenzepine blocked orexin- or butyrate-induced intestinal barrier function improvement. These results suggest that BFCNs improve leaky gut through adenosine A2B signaling and the vagal pathway. Furthermore, BFCNs mediate orexin- or butyrate-induced intestinal barrier function improvement. Since BFCNs play a role in cognitive function and a leaky gut is associated with dementia, the present finding may lead us to speculate that BFCNs are involved in the development of dementia by regulating intestinal barrier function. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: It is well-established that several features of modern lifestyles, such as shift work, jet lag, and using electronics at night, disturb normal circadian rhythm and increase the risk of suffering from functional gastrointestinal disease. Although substantial evidence demonstrates that shift work is closely correlated with the symptoms of visceral hypersensitivity, few basic studies have revealed the mechanism of visceral hypersensitivity induced by circadian rhythm disturbance, especially light/dark phase shifts. Our study explored the mechanism underlying visceral hypersensitivity caused by light/dark phase shift in mice. Methods: A 6-h delay light/dark phase shift mice model was constructed. Visceral hypersensitivity was assessed by abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score induced by colorectal distention (CRD) in vivo and contraction of colonic muscle strips induced by acetylcholine ex vivo. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by transepithelial resistance (TEER) and FD4 permeability. The expression of tight junction proteins was detected by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The gut microbiota was examined by 16S rDNA sequencing. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to confirm the relationship between the light/dark phase shift, gut microbiota, and visceral hypersensitivity. Results: We found that light/dark phase shift increased visceral sensitivity and disrupted intestinal barrier function, caused low-grade intestinal inflammation. Moreover, we found decreased microbial species richness and diversity and a shift in microbial community with a decreased proportion of Firmicutes and an elevated abundance of Proteobacteria at the phylum level. Besides, after the light/dark phase shift, the microflora was significantly enriched in biosynthesizing tryptophan, steroid hormone, secondary metabolites, lipids, and lipopolysaccharides. Mice that underwent FMT from the light/dark phase shift mice model exhibited higher visceral hypersensitivity and worse barrier function. Dysbiosis induced by light/dark phase shift can be transmitted to the mice pretreated with antibiotics by FMT not only at the aspect of microbiota composition but also at the level of bacterial function. Conclusion: Circadian rhythm disturbance induced by the light/dark phase shift produces visceral hypersensitivity similar to the pathophysiology of IBS through modulating the gut microbiota, which may disrupt intestinal barrier function or induce a low-degree gut inflammation.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders. Its pathophysiology is diverse and variable, involving disturbed gut-brain interactions, altered motility and secretion, visceral hypersensitivity, increased intestinal permeability, immune activation, and changes in gut microbiota. Complaints experienced by patients suffering from IBS and its co-morbidities strongly impair quality of life (QoL), and available treatments are often unsatisfactory. Anecdotal reports and preclinical data suggest that the endocannabinoid system and functionally related mechanisms could offer treatment targets. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a candidate agent of interest with a broad molecular target profile and the absence of psychoactive properties. Materials and Methods: In 32 female IBS patients, we explored the effect of a chewing gum formulation containing 50 mg CBD on abdominal pain and perceived well-being in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Chewing gums were used on-demand guided by pain symptoms with a maximum of six per day. Pain intensity was assessed by a visual analogue scale (scale 0.0-10.0), and QoL was evaluated with the IBS-36 questionnaire. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores between CBD and placebo at a group level. Subgroup and individual analyses showed a highly variable picture. No indications were found for symptom-driven intake, which also remained lower than expected overall. Conclusions: With the current design, based on the assumption that IBS patients would adjust their intake to their perceived symptom relief, no differences at the group level were found between CBD and placebo gum in pain scores and the number of gums used. The low use of the gums also indicates that the benefits experienced by these patients generally did not outweigh practical disadvantages such as prolonged chewing throughout the day. The very high intra- A nd inter-individual variation in IBS symptoms warrant future trials that are more personalized, for example by applying an N-of-1 (rotating) design with individualized dose titration. © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - Background Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction (leaky gut syndrome, LGS) is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of disorders of the gut brain axis. Endoscopic confocal laser endomicroscopy (eCLE) is an objective measure to test duodenal permeability. We applied this technique in patients with functional gastrointestinal symptoms and food intolerance to characterize the proportion of patients with LGS. Material and Methods In an observational study, we evaluated 85 patients with functional gastrointestinal symptoms and food intolerance. Gastrointestinal symptoms were classified according to Rom IV into functional abdominal pain (FAP), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea dominant (IBS-D), irritable bowel syndrome constipation dominant (IBS-C), irritable bowel syndrome with mixed stool (IBS-M), functional abdominal bloating (FAB), functional diarrhea (FD) and unclassified (NC). During eCLE, spontaneous transfer of intravenously applied fluorescein into duodenal lumen (LGS) and following duodenal food challenge (DFC) were analyzed. Blood analysis comprised parameters of mast cell function, histology of duodenal mucosal biopsies analysis of mucosal inflammation, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) as well as number, distribution and morphology of mast cells. Results 24 patients (9 IBS, 9 FAP, 3 FAB, 1 FD, 2 NC), showed LGS, 50 patients (14 IBS-D, 4 IBS-C, 3 IBS-M, 23 FAP, 3 FAB, 3 NC) had no LGS but responded to DFC and 11 patients (6 NC, 3 FAP, 1 FAB, 1 FD) had no LGS and no response to DFC. The proportion of subgroups with/or without spontaneous leakage of fluorescein (+LGS/-LGS) were IBS-LGS/IBS+LGS 67%/33%, FAP-LGS/FAP+LGS 72%/28%,FAB-LGS/FAB+LGS 50%/50%, NC-LGS/NC+LGS 60%/40%. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences for all parameters tested. Conclusion As a proof of concept, the results of our study indicate that eCLE is a clinical useful tool to evaluate patients with disorders of the gut brain axis and those suspicious of LGS. However, the clinical significance of LGS remains unclear. The study should be an incentive to perform a randomized study including healthy controls. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorder. Although the main reason for IBS is not clear, the interaction between intestinal microorganisms and the gut barrier seems to play an important role in pathogenesis of IBS. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of Blastocystis on the gut microbiota profile and the circulation levels of microRNA (mir)-16 of IBS patients compared to healthy subjects. Stool and blood samples were collected from 80 participants including 40 samples from each IBS and healthy group. Upon DNA extraction from stool samples, barcoding region and quantitative real-time PCR were analyzed to investigate Blastocystis and the microbiota profile, respectively. RNA was extracted from serum samples of included subjects and the expression of mir-16 was evaluated using stem-loop protocol and qreal-time PCR. Significant changes between IBS patients and healthy controls was observed in Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Faecalibacterium, and Alistipes. In IBS patients, the relative abundance of Bifidobacteria was directly correlated with the presence of Blastocystis, while Alistipes was decreased with Blastocystis. Lactobacillus was significantly increased in Blastocystis carriers. In healthy subjects, the relative abundance of Bifidobacteria was decreased, but Alistipes was increased in Blastocystis carriers. The changes in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was not significant in different groups. The relative expression of mir-16 in Blastocystis-negative IBS patients and healthy carriers was significantly overexpressed compared to control group. The presence of Blastocystis, decreased the relative expression of mir-16 in IBS patients compared to Blastocystis-negative IBS patients. The present study revealed that Blastocystis has the ability to change the abundance of some phyla/genera of bacteria in IBS and healthy subjects. Moreover, Blastocystis seems to modulate the relative expression of microRNAs to control the gut atmosphere, apply its pathogenicity, and provide a favor niche for its colonization. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The common disorders irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can modify the drugs' pharmacokinetics via their induced pathophysiological changes. This work aimed to investigate the impact of these two diseases on pravastatin oral bioavailability. Rat models for IBS and IBD were used to experimentally test the effects of IBS and IBD on pravastatin pharmacokinetics. Then, the observations made in rats were extrapolated to humans using a mechanistic whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (wbPBPK) model. The rat in vivo studies done herein showed that IBS and IBD decreased serum albumin (> 11% for both), decreased PRV binding in plasma, and increased pravastatin absolute oral bioavailability (0.17 and 0.53 compared to 0.01) which increased plasma, muscle, and liver exposure. However, the wbPBPK model predicted muscle concentration was much lower than the pravastatin toxicity thresholds for myotoxicity and rhabdomyolysis. Overall, IBS and IBD can significantly increase pravastatin oral bioavailability which can be due to a combination of increased pravastatin intestinal permeability and decreased pravastatin gastric degradation resulting in higher exposure. This is the first study in the literature investigating the effects of IBS and IBD on pravastatin pharmacokinetics. The high interpatient variability in pravastatin concentrations as induced by IBD and IBS can be reduced by oral administration of pravastatin using enteric-coated tablets. Such disease (IBS and IBD)-drug interaction can have more drastic consequences for narrow therapeutic index drugs prone to gastric degradation, especially for drugs with low intestinal permeability.

AB  - Background: Intestinal barrier dysfunction is crucial in alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). The decreased beta-Klotho (KLB) expression caused by gene variation is associated with hyperpermeability in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Here we investigated the roles of intestinal KLB in maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier in ALD and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: We constructed the intestine-specific overexpression KLB mice to investigate the role of KLB on alcohol-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and liver injury in an ALD mouse model. To investigate the molecular mechanism in vitro, Caco2 cells were cultured and infected with the KLB overexpression lentivirus, or transfected with KLB/TRPV6 siRNA, or TRPV6/FXR1 overexpression plasmid, and treated with or without ethanol. Findings: The upregulation of KLB in enterocytes effectively protected mice from alcohol-induced intestinal barrier hyperpermeability, thereby ameliorating hepatic steatosis and inflammation. KLB competitively suppressed FXR1 binding to the TRPV6 mRNA, increasing TRPV6 mRNA stability and protein abundance in intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, KLB formed a complex with TRPV6 and tight junction (TJ) proteins, protecting against alcohol-induced TJ proteins endocytosis and degradation as well as intestinal barrier impairment. Interpretation: This work suggested that KLB attenuated alcohol-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction and liver injury through FXR1/TRPV6/TJ proteins pathway.

AB  - Background: Impaired intestinal permeability and microbial dysbiosis are important pathophysiological mechanisms underlying irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). ReFerm®, also called Profermin®, is a postbiotic product of oat gruel fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v. In this study, we investigated whether ReFerm® has a beneficial effect on the intestinal epithelial barrier function in patients with IBS. Materials and methods: Thirty patients with moderate to severe IBS-diarrhoea (IBS-D) or IBS-mixed (IBS-M) were treated with enema containing ReFerm® or placebo. The patients underwent sigmoidoscopy with biopsies obtained from the distal colon at baseline and after 14 days of treatment with ReFerm® or placebo twice daily. The biopsies were mounted in Ussing chambers, and paracellular and transcellular permeabilities were measured for 120 min. In addition, the effects of ReFerm® or placebo on the epithelial barrier were investigated in vitro using Caco-2 cells. Results: ReFerm® reduced paracellular permeability (p < 0.05) and increased transepithelial resistance (TER) over time (p < 0.01), whereas the placebo had no significant effect in patients. In ReFerm®-treated Caco-2 cells, paracellular and transcellular permeabilities were decreased compared to the control (p < 0.05) and placebo (p < 0.01). TER was increased in Caco-2 ReFerm®-treated cells, and normalised TER was increased in ReFerm®-treated Caco-2 cells compared to control (p < 0.05) and placebo-treated (p < 0.05) cells. Conclusion: ReFerm® significantly reduced paracellular permeability and improved TER in colonic biopsies collected from patients with IBS and in a Caco-2 cell model. Our results offer new insights into the potential benefits of ReFerm® in IBS management. Further studies are needed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the barrier-protective properties of ReFerm®.

AB  - Background: In patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), the diarrheal mechanisms are largely unknown, and they were examined in this study on colon biopsies. Methods: Electrophysiological measurements were used for monitoring functional changes in the diarrheic colon specimens. In parallel, tight junction protein expression was analyzed by Western blot and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, and signaling pathway analysis was performed using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. Results: Epithelial resistance was decreased, indicating an epithelial leak flux diarrheal mechanism with a molecular correlate of decreased claudin-1 expression, while induction of active anion secretion and impairment of active sodium absorption via the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, were not detected. The pathway analysis revealed activation of barrier-affecting cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β and IL-4. Conclusions: Barrier dysfunction as a result of epithelial tight junction changes plays a role in IBS-D as a pathomechanism inducing a leak flux type of diarrhea. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Oral administration of probiotics has been proposed as a promising biotherapy to prevent and treat different diseases related to gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Due to the increasing research area on the characterisation of new probiotic bacterial strains, it is necessary to perform suitable in vitro experiments, using pertinent cellular models, in order to establish appropriate readout profiles based on IBS symptoms and subtypes. In this work, a collection of 30 candidate strains, belonging mainly to the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, were screened using three different sets of in vitro experiments with different readouts to identify promising probiotic strains with: (1) the ability to inhibit the synthesis of IL-8 production by TNF-α stimulated HT-29 cells, (2) immunomodulatory properties quantified as increased IL-10 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs), and (3) the ability to maintain epithelial barrier integrity by increasing the trans-epithelial/endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values in Caco-2 cells. Based on these criteria, three strains were selected: Lactobacillus gasseri PI41, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus PI48 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis PI50, and tested in a murine model of low-grade inflammation induced by dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS), which mimics some of the symptoms of IBS. Among the three strains, L. gasseri PI41 improved overall host well-being by preventing body weight loss in DNBS-treated mice and restored gut homeostasis by normalising the intestinal permeability and reducing pro-inflammatory markers. Therefore, the potential of this strain was confirmed in a second murine model known to reproduce IBS symptoms: the neonatal maternal separation (NMS) model. The PI41 strain was effective in preventing intestinal permeability and reducing colonic hypersensitivity. In conclusion, the set of in vitro experiments combined with in vivo assessments allowed us to identify a promising probiotic candidate strain, L. gasseri PI41, in the context of IBS.

AB  - Treatment strategies for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) continue to improve. However, effective drugs are still lacking. Herein, we explored whether sodium hyaluronate (SH) could be used to treat IBS-C. The effects of SH with different molecular weights were compared in a rat model of IBS-C. Low-molecular-weight SH (LMW-SH, 5 ∼ 10 kDa), medium-molecular-weight SH (MMW-SH, 200 ∼ 400 kDa), and high-molecular-weight SH (HMW-SH, 1300 ∼ 1500 kDa) were screened for efficacy in IBS-C using the following indicators: body weight, number of fecal pellets, fecal moisture, visceral hypersensitivity, and gastrointestinal transit rate. H-HMW-SH was the most effective in improving IBS-C symptoms. The ELISA kits indicated that H-HMW-SH reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α in IBS-C rats. In addition, both western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed that H-HMW-SH increased the protein expressions of claudin-1, occludin and zonula occludens-1. Furthermore, H-HMW-SH restored the balance of intestinal flora in different intestinal contents (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon) and feces of rats with IBS-C. Overall, our study illustrates the therapeutic potential of H-HMW-SH in the treatment of IBS-C. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Antibiotics disrupt normal gut microbiota and cause dysbiosis, leading to a reduction in intestinal epithelial barrier function. Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, which is known as “leaky gut”, results in increased intestinal permeability and contributes to the development or exacerbation of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. We have previously reported on a murine model of intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction associated with dysbiosis induced by the administration of ampicillin and vancomycin. Saireito, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, is often used to treat autoimmune disorders including ulcerative colitis; the possible mechanism of action and its efficacy, however, remains unclear. In this study, we examined the efficacy of Saireito in our animal model for leaky gut associated with dysbiosis. C57BL/6 mice were fed a Saireito diet for the entirety of the protocol (day1-28). To induce colitis, ampicillin and vancomycin were administered in drinking water for the last seven consecutive days (day22-28). As previously demonstrated, treatment with antibiotics caused fecal occult bleeding, cecum enlargement with black discoloration, colon inflammation with epithelial cell apoptosis, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Oral administration of Saireito significantly improved antibiotics-induced fecal occult bleeding and cecum enlargement by suppressing inflammation in the colon. Furthermore, Saireito treatment ensured the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier by suppressing apoptosis and inducing cell adhesion proteins including ZO-1, occludin, and E-cadherin in intestinal epithelial cells, which in turn decreased intestinal epithelial permeability. Moreover, the reduced microbial diversity seen in the gut of mice treated with antibiotics was remarkably improved with the administration of Saireito. In addition, Saireito altered the composition of gut microbiota in these mice. These results suggest that Saireito alleviates leaky gut caused by antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Our findings provide a potentially new therapeutic strategy for antibiotic-related gastrointestinal disorders. Copyright: © 2022 Ozaka et al.

AB  - The association between H. pylori and small intestinal permeability (IP) on serum testosterone levels in men as mediated by metabolic endotoxemia remains unclear. We sought to explore relationships using correlational analysis between H. pylori IgG class antibody levels and small IP via dual sugar probe analysis on T levels in 50 male participants of reproductive age. Sleep quality, physical activity levels, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptom severity were measured as potential confounders. Measures for H. pylori (antibodies) increased small IP (lactulose/rhamnose ratio), and hypogonadism (testosterone) did not exceed diagnostic cut-off values for respective pathologies. There was no correlation between lactulose/rhamnose e ratio and GI function markers, zonulin, H. pylori, and IBS questionnaire scores; inflammatory markers, high-sensitivity C-reactive Protein (hsCRP) and Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Protein (LBP); nor endocrine markers, testosterone, Luteinizing hormone (LH), and Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). There was a moderate inverse relationship revealed between IBS symptom severity and LBP (r = −0.457, p = 0.004); and hsCRP and testosterone (r = −0.398, p = 0.004). This was independent of physical activity level and sleep quality, but not BMI, which supports the existing link between adiposity, inflammation, and hypogonadism currently present in the literature. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Food processing alters diet digestibility and composition, thereby influencing interactions between host biology, diet, and the gut microbiota. The fecal metabolome offers insight into those relations by providing a readout of diet–microbiota interactions impacting host health. Objectives: The aims were to determine the effects of consuming a processed diet on the fecal metabolome and to explore relations between changes in the fecal metabolome with fecal microbiota composition and gastrointestinal health markers. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial wherein healthy adults [94% male; 18–61 y; BMI (kg/m2): 26 ± 3] consumed their usual diet [control (CON), n = 27] or a Meal, Ready-to-EatTM (Ameriqual Packaging) military ration diet composed of processed, shelf-stable, ready-to-eat items for 21 d (MRE; n = 27). Fecal metabolite profiles, fecal microbiota composition, biomarkers of intestinal barrier function, and gastrointestinal symptoms were measured before and after the intervention. Between-group differences and associations were assessed using nonparametric t tests, partial least-squares discriminant analysis, correlation, and redundancy analysis. Results: Fecal concentrations of multiple dipeptides [Mann-Whitney effect size (ES) = 0.27–0.50] and long-chain SFAs (ES = 0.35–0.58) increased, whereas plant-derived compounds (ES = 0.31–0.60) decreased in MRE versus CON (P < 0.05; q < 0.20). Changes in dipeptides correlated positively with changes in fecal concentrations of Maillard-reaction products (ρ = 0.29–0.70; P < 0.05) and inversely with changes in serum prealbumin (ρ = −0.30 to −0.48; P ≤ 0.03). Multiple bile acids, coffee and caffeine metabolites, and plant-derived compounds were associated with both fecal microbiota composition and gastrointestinal health markers, with changes in fecal microbiota composition explaining 26% of the variability within changes in gastrointestinal health–associated fecal metabolites (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Changes in the fecal metabolomes of adults consuming a Meal, Ready-to-EatTM diet implicate interactions between diet composition, diet digestibility, and the gut microbiota as contributing to variability within gastrointestinal responses to the diet. Findings underscore the need to consider both food processing and nutrient composition when investigating the impact of diet–gut microbiota interactions on health outcomes.

AB  - The brain-gut-microbiota (BGM) axis is known to be essential for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). In order to evaluate the effects of IBS-D rat models (the central sensitization model, the peripheral sensitization model and the compound model) on the BGM axis, five models were induced in Wistar rats with 4% acetic acid (AD, dissolved 0.4 ml of AD in 9.6 ml of ultrapure water) + wrap restrain stress (WRS), 4% AD, colorectal distention (CRD), WRS, and neonatal maternal separation (NMS). Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scale scores and the moisture content of feces (MCF) were evaluated on the day of completing modeling. Body weight was measured every 7 days during modeling. Brain gut peptides, cytokine levels, the activity of spinal cord neurons, intestinal mucosal barrier function, and gut microbiota were determined after induction of IBS-D. We found intervention with 4% AD + WRS, 4% AD, CRD, WRS, and NMS induced a similar course of effects on the BGM axis. Among the five models, AWR scores (60 mmHg, 80 mmHg) were all increased. The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, corticotropin-releasing factor, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related protein in serum rapidly increased, whereas that of neuropeptide Y decreased. C-fos in the spinal cord showed increased neuronal activity. The intestinal permeability was increased and the composition and structure of gut microbiota were changed. In conclusion, the five models could cause changes in BGM axis, but the 4% AD + WRS model was closer to the changes BGM axis of post-inflammatory models of IBS-D. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is multifactorial, characterized in part by increased intestinal permeability, and visceral hypersensitivity. Increased permeability is associated with IBS severity and abdominal pain. Tenapanor is FDA-approved for the treatment of IBS with constipation (IBS-C) and has demonstrated improvements in bowel motility and a reduction in IBS-related pain; however, the mechanism by which tenapanor mediates these functions remains unclear. Here, the effects of tenapanor on colonic pain signaling and intestinal permeability were assessed through behavioral, electrophysiological, and cell culture experiments. Intestinal motility studies in rats and humans demonstrated that tenapanor increased luminal sodium and water retention and gastrointestinal transit versus placebo. A significantly reduced visceral motor reflex (VMR) to colonic distension was observed with tenapanor treatment versus vehicle in two rat models of visceral hypersensitivity (neonatal acetic acid sensitization and partial restraint stress; both P < 0.05), returning VMR responses to that of nonsensitized controls. Whole cell voltage patch-clamp recordings of retrogradely labeled colonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons from sensitized rats found that tenapanor significantly reduced DRG neuron hyperexcitability to capsaicin versus vehicle (P < 0.05), an effect not mediated by epithelial cell secretions. Tenapanor also attenuated increases in intestinal permeability in human colon monolayer cultures caused by incubation with proinflammatory cytokines (P < 0.001) or fecal supernatants from patients with IBS-C (P < 0.005). These results support a model in which tenapanor reduces IBS-related pain by strengthening the intestinal barrier, thereby decreasing permeability to macromolecules and antigens and reducing DRG-mediated pain signaling. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder that affects the large intestine, which encompasses several symptoms including, but not limited to, abdominal pain, bloating and dysmotility. In particular, IBS associated with constipation (IBS-C) is characterized by hard and dry stools and inadequate evacuation and difficulty in defecation. Although several drugs ameliorate intestinal modifications and constipation-associated features, management of IBS is still a challenge. Natural compounds including Xyloglucan and pea protein (XP) and Chia seed powder (CS) are widely known to possess beneficial effects in counteracting several gastrointestinal disorders. Here, we aimed to assess the combined effects of XP and CS to treat constipation-related alterations in an IBS-C rat model. IBS-C was induced by gastric instillation of 2 mL of cold water (0–4 °C) for 14 days and Xiloglucan, Pea protein and Chia seeds (XP + CS) treatment was orally administered for 7 days. On day 22, colon tissues were collected for histological analysis. Our results showed that XP + CS administration attenuated constipation-related parameters by increasing body weight and food and water intake. Upon XP + CS treatment, from day 14 to 22, stool moisture content was restored to physiological level. Colonic tissues from IBS-C rats depicted a disruption of the organ architecture accompanied by edema. Loss of colonic structure was reflected by the marked reduction of tight junction protein expression, Occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). Administration of XP + CS treatment in IBS-C rats significantly ameliorated the colonic histological parameters and exerted a positive effect on barrier integrity by restoring the expression of Occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). Our findings demonstrated that the efficacy of XP and CS in managing constipation in rats is due to the ability of these compounds to form a protective barrier fortifying intestinal integrity and gut functionality. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Intestinal barrier dysfunction, leaky gut, is implicated in various diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Our recent investigation revealed that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), critical for cognitive function, receive signals from butyrate and orexin, playing a role in regulating intestinal barrier function through adenosine A2B signaling and the vagus. This study explores the involvement and function of brain histamine, linked to BFCNs, in the regulation of intestinal barrier function. Colonic permeability, assessed by quantifying absorbed Evans blue in rat colonic tissue, showed that histamine did not affect increased colonic permeability induced by LPS when administered subcutaneously. However, intracisternal histamine administration improved colonic hyperpermeability. Elevating endogenous histamine levels in the brain with SKF91488, a histamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor, also improved colonic hyperpermeability. This effect was abolished by intracisternal chlorpheniramine, an histamine H1 receptor antagonist, not ranitidine, an H2 receptor antagonist. The SKF91488-induced improvement in colonic hyperpermeability was blocked by vagotomy, intracisternal pirenzepine (suppressing BFCNs activity), or alloxazine (an adenosine A2B receptor antagonist). Additionally, intracisternal chlorpheniramine injection eliminated butyrate-induced improvement in colonic hyperpermeability. These findings suggest that brain histamine, acting via the histamine H1 receptor, regulates intestinal barrier function involving BFCNs, adenosine A2B signaling, and the vagus. Brain histamine appears to centrally regulate intestinal barrier function influenced by butyrate, differentiating its actions from peripheral histamine in conditions like IBS, where mast cell-derived histamine induces leaky gut. Brain histamine emerges as a potential pharmacological target for diseases associated with leaky gut, such as dementia and IBS. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Destruction of the intestinal mucosal barrier and visceral hypersensitivity are main pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The study aimed to establish a rat model of visceral hypersensitivity and explore mechanisms involved the changes of the intestinal barrier protein expression and intestinal flora. Methods: A rat model of visceral hypersensitivity was established and evaluated using abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores, colonic paracellular permeability, and gastrointestinal motility. The expression of tight junction proteins, aquaporin proteins (AQPs), phosphorylated ERK, and proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) was determined. The intestinal microflora was evaluated by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Key results: In model rats, AWR score and fecal water content were significantly increased, gastrointestinal motilities were disorder and characterized by an inhibition of gastric motility and an enhancement of small intestinal and colonic movement. The expressions of colonic occludin, ZO-1, AQP3, and AQP8 were decreased but claudin-2 and claudin-4 were markedly increased. Imbalance of intestinal flora appeared and showed an obvious decrease of Lactobacillus and an increase of Clostridiales_bacterium. Additionally, the total serine protease activity in feces, the expressions of PAR2 and phosphorylated ERK in the colon tissues were increased significantly. Conclusion and inferences: The model rats of visceral hypersensitivity possess the decreased expression of occludin, ZO-1, AQP3, AQP8, and the increased expression of claudin-2 and claudin-4, meanwhile develop an imbalance of intestinal flora which probably increase serine protease activity, thereby activating the PAR2/ERK signaling and causing the intestinal barrier disorder. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: Mild blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) induces various gut symptoms resembling human irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as one of mental and behavioral disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated whether the extremely localized brain impact extracranially induced by laser-induced shock wave (LISW) evoked IBS-like phenomenon including visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal hyperpermeability in rats. Methods: The rats were subjected to LISW on the scalp to shock the entire brain. Visceral hypersensitivity was evaluated by the threshold pressure of abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) using a colorectal distension test. Permeability was evaluated by the concentration of penetrating FITC-dextran from intestine and the mRNA expression levels of tight junction family proteins. Involvement of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR) 1 and 2 was examined by evaluating mRNA expression and modulating CRFR function with agonist, recombinant CRF (10 μg/kg), and antagonist, astressin (33 μg/kg). High-throughput sequencing of the gut microbiota was performed by MiSeqIII instrument and QIIME tool. Key Results: The thresholds of the AWR were significantly lowered after LISW. Permeability was increased in small intestine by LISW along with decreased expression of tight junction ZO-1. LISW significantly increased CRFR1 expression and decreased CRFR2 expression. Visceral hypersensitivity was significantly aggravated by CRFR agonist and suppressed by CRFR antagonist. The α- and β-diversity of the fecal microbiota was altered after LISW. Conclusions and Inferences: LISW provoked visceral hypersensitivity, small intestinal hyperpermeability, altered expression of CRFRs and changes in the microbiota, suggesting that genuine bTBI caused by LISW can induce a pathophysiology comparable to that of human IBS. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Aim. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial functional bowel disorder characterized by disruption of the intestinal barrier. Circulating exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in regulating epithelial barrier function, and upregulation of miR-148b-5p has been detected in IBS. However, whether exosomal miR-148-5p is involved in the IBS pathogenesis remains unclear. This study was aimed at investigating the relationship of exosomal miR-148-5p with colonic epithelial permeability. Methods. Exosomes were isolated from the serum of IBS patients and healthy controls. HT-29 cells were cultured with the IBS-derived serum exosomes (IBS-exo). Exosome uptake assay was used to evaluate whether the IBS-exo could be absorbed by HT-29 cells. FITC-Dextran flux and transepithelial/endothelial electrical resistance were measured to evaluate epithelial permeability. A luciferase reporter assay was used to determine whether the regulator of G protein signaling- (RGS-) 2 is a target gene of miR-148b-5p. Results. miR-148b-5p was obviously elevated in the IBS-exo compared to the control-exo. Upregulation of miR-148b-5p was observed in the HT-29 cells cultured with IBS-exo. Exposure to IBS-exo increased cell permeability and decreased RGS2 expression. The IBS-exo-induced alterations were obviously reversed by interfering with the miR-148b-5p expression. Mimicking the IBS-exo treatment, miR-148b-5p overexpression increased cell permeability and downregulated RGS2 expression, which were abrogated by overexpressing RGS2. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that RGS2 was a direct target of miR-148b-5p. Conclusions. Serum-derived exosomes from IBS patients increase colonic epithelial permeability via miR-148b-5p/RGS2 signaling.  © 2021 Ying Xing et al.

AB  - Alterations in brain/gut/microbiota axis are linked to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) physiopathology. Upon gastrointestinal infection, chronic abdominal pain and anxio-depressive comorbidities may persist despite pathogen clearance leading to Post-Infectious IBS (PI-IBS). This study assesses the influence of tryptophan metabolism, and particularly the microbiota-induced AhR expression, on intestinal homeostasis disturbance following gastroenteritis resolution, and evaluates the efficacy of IL-22 cytokine vectorization on PI-IBS symptoms. The Citrobacter rodentium infection model in C57BL6/J mice was used to mimic Enterobacteria gastroenteritis. Intestinal homeostasis was evaluated as low-grade inflammation, permeability, mucosa-associated microbiota composition, and colonic sensitivity. Cognitive performances and emotional state of animals were assessed using several tests. Tryptophan metabolism was analyzed by targeted metabolomics. AhR activity was evaluated using a luciferase reporter assay method. One Lactococcus lactis strain carrying an eukaryotic expression plasmid for murine IL-22 (L. lactis IL−22) was used to induce IL-22 production in mouse colonic mucosa. C. rodentium-infected mice exhibited persistent colonic hypersensitivity and cognitive impairments and anxiety-like behaviors after pathogen clearance. These post-infectious disorders were associated with low-grade inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, decrease of Lactobacillaceae abundance associated with the colonic layer, and increase of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). During post-infection period, the indole pathway and AhR activity were decreased due to a reduction of tryptophol production. Treatment with L. lactis IL−22 restored gut permeability and normalized colonic sensitivity, restored cognitive performances and decreased anxiety-like behaviors. Data from the video-tracking system suggested an upgrade of welfare for mice receiving the L.lactis IL−22 strain. Our findings revealed that AhR/IL-22 signaling pathway is altered in a preclinical PI-IBS model. IL-22 delivering alleviate PI-IBS symptoms as colonic hypersensitivity, cognitive impairments, and anxiety-like behaviors by acting on intestinal mucosa integrity. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway could be developed to treat IBS patients suffering from chronic abdominal pain and associated well-being disorders. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective To investigate the association between adherens junction proteins E‑cadherin and β‑catenin and tight junction protein claudin‑2 and clinical symptoms in patients with diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS‑D). Methods Cecal biopsy tissues were collected from IBS‑D patients (n=26) according to Rome Ⅲ criterion and healthy controls (n=26). The duration of symptoms, abdominal pain score and mean weekly bowel movements were recorded. Colorectal dilatation combined with restraint stress were applied to establish visceral hypersensitivity rat model. Abdominal contraction reflex (AWR) was applied to assess the visceral sensitivity in rats. The stool frequency within 1 hour was recorded after establishing the rat model. The expression of E‑cadherin、β‑catenin and claudin‑2 were assessed by Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. Intercellular ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Results Compared with the healthy controls, the protein expression of E‑cadherin and β‑catenin in cecal epithelium in IBS‑D patients were significantly lower (P= 0.015 and P=0.005, respectively), while claudin‑2 was significantly higher (P=0.000). Reduced E‑cadherin and β‑catenin expression was associated high abdominal pain score (r=-0.463, P=0.017 and r=-0.407, P= 0.039). The lower expression of β‑catenin was associated with longer duration of symptoms (r=-0.458, P= 0.019). The protein expression of E‑cadherin and ß‑catenin in the cecal epithelium of the visceral hypersensitivity rats were significantly lower (P=0.004 and P=0.003, respectively), while claudin‑2 was significantly higher (P=0.008). Reduced E‑cadherin and ß‑catenin expression was associated high visceral sensitivity in IBS‑D rats (r=- 0.639, P=0.047 and r=- 0.888, P=0.001). Conclusions Intercellular ultrastructure alterations well as cecal β‑catenin and E‑cadherin protein expression decrease and are associated with high abdominal pain score in IBS‑D patients and hypersensitivity rats. β‑catenin is further associated with prolonged duration of symptoms in IBS‑D patients. The expression of E‑cadherin and β‑catenin may play a vital role in visceral sensitivity and intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS‑D. © 2021 Chinese Journal of Geological Hazard and Control.

AB  - Background: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or repeated water avoidance stress (WAS) induces visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and proinflammatory cytokines, which is considered to be a rat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) model. As losartan is known to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine release, we hypothesized that it improves these visceral changes. Methods: The threshold of visceromotor response (VMR), that is, abdominal muscle contractions induced by colonic balloon distention was electrophysiologically measured in rats. Colonic permeability was determined in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue for 15 minutes spectrophotometrically. Key Results: Lipopolysaccharide (1 mg kg−1) subcutaneously (s.c.) reduced the threshold of VMR and increased colonic permeability. Losartan (5-25 mg kg−1 s.c.) for 3 days inhibited these changes in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, repeated WAS (1 hour daily for 3 days) or intraperitoneal injection of CRF (50 µg kg−1) induced the similar visceral changes as LPS, which were also eliminated by losartan. These effects by losartan in LPS model were reversed by GW9662 (a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ [PPAR-γ] antagonist), NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (a nitric oxide [NO] synthesis inhibitor), or naloxone (an opioid receptor antagonist). Moreover, it also inhibited by sulpiride (a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist) or domperidone (a peripheral dopamine D2 antagonist). Conclusion & Inferences: Losartan prevented visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability in rat IBS models. These actions may be PPAR-γ–dependent and also mediated by the NO, opioid, and dopamine D2 pathways. Losartan may be useful for IBS treatment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The gut barrier plays an important role in human health. When barrier function is impaired, altered permeability and barrier dysfunction can occur, leading to inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome or obesity. Several bacteria, including pathogens and commensals, have been found to directly or indirectly modulate intestinal barrier function. The use of probiotic strains could be an important landmark in the management of gut dysfunction with a clear impact on the general population. Previously, we found that Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 can protect intestinal barrier functions in mice inflammation model. Here, we investigated its mechanism of action. Our results show that CNCM I-3690 can (i) physically maintain modulated goblet cells and the mucus layer and (ii) counteract changes in local and systemic lymphocytes. Furthermore, mice colonic transcriptome analysis revealed that CNCM I-3690 enhances the expression of genes related to healthy gut permeability: motility and absorption, cell proliferation; and protective functions by inhibiting endogenous proteases. Finally, SpaFED pili are clearly important effectors since an L. rhamnosus ΔspaF mutant failed to provide the same benefits as the wild type strain. Taken together, our data suggest that CNCM I-3690 restores impaired intestinal barrier functions via anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective responses. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The article presents an analysis of literature data on the violation of intestinal permeability as one of the pathogenetic factors of irritable bowel syndrome. The structure of tight junctions is considered in detail as an impor-tant element of the normal functioning of the intestinal barrier. The researches that previously studied the expression of tight junction components in patients with irritable bowel syndrome were considered. The results of our own study with the evaluation of occludin expression in patients with irritable bowel syndrome are shown. It has been found that the expression of occludin is lower in patients with irritable bowel syndrome compared with healthy individuals. © «Gastroenterology» («Gastroenterologìa»), 2019.

AB  - Background: Fecal calprotectin is a valuable non-invasive marker for intestinal inflammation and contributes to the selection of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for endoscopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of three automated immunoassays for fecal calprotectin (FC), fecal lactoferrin (FL) and fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) for diagnosis and follow-up of IBD, to investigate if automated analysis of this biomarker profile may further improve the diagnostic process, and to compare them to manual ELISA tests from different manufacturers. Methods: Stool samples from 72 patients with Crohn's disease (42), ulcerative colitis (17), irritable bowel syndrome (5), other gastrointestinal inflammation (8), and 72 healthy controls were analyzed for FC, FL, and A1AT on the automated Alegria® system (ORGENTEC Diagnostika, Germany). The results were verified by commercially available manual ELISA tests and discrepancies were further analyzed by immunoblotting. The fecal test results were correlated with the patients' endoscopic findings and with disease activity. Results: The automated assays FC and FL for Alegria® detected endoscopically active intestinal inflammation with a sensitivity and specificity of 74% and 87% (FC) and 62% and 87% (FL), respectively, and efficiently discriminated IBD from non-IBD samples in the patient cohort. Healthy controls tested negative in all assays. The results of the automated biomarker assays significantly correlated to those of the manual ELISAs. Alegria® results for FC were confirmed by immunoblotting in 7 discrepant samples. Levels of A1AT out of the normal range were detectable in a substantial number of IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) samples: 50% Crohn's disease, 35% ulcerative colitis, and 60% IBS, reflecting the disease-related changes of intestinal permeability in these patients. In IBD patients, elevated levels of A1AT correlated with relapsing disease. Conclusions: Measurement of FC concentrations with Alegria® is a convenient, promising, and useful tool for improving laboratory diagnostic accuracy and accelerating the diagnostic process and helps to identify those patients in whom endoscopy may be avoided. Automated analysis of a comprehensive profile of fecal biomarkers with Alegria®, including A1AT, provides further substantial benefit for laboratory diagnostics of IBD by improving stratification of patients for treatment and care. © 2020 Verlag Klinisches Labor GmbH.

AB  - Objective The intestinal lumen contains several proteases. Our aim was to determine the role of faecal proteases in mediating barrier dysfunction and symptoms in IBS. Design 39 patients with IBS and 25 healthy volunteers completed questionnaires, assessments of in vivo permeability, ex vivo colonic barrier function in Ussing chambers, tight junction (TJ) proteins, ultrastructural morphology and 16 s sequencing of faecal microbiota rRNA. A casein-based assay was used to measure proteolytic activity (PA) in faecal supernatants (FSNs). Colonic barrier function was determined in mice (ex-germ free) humanised with microbial communities associated with different human PA states. Results Patients with IBS had higher faecal PA than healthy volunteers. 8/20 postinfection IBS (PI-IBS) and 3/19 constipation- predominant IBS had high PA (>95th percentile). High-PA patients had more and looser bowel movements, greater symptom severity and higher in vivo and ex vivo colonic permeability. High-PA FSNs increased paracellular permeability, decreased occludin and increased phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) expression. Serine but not cysteine protease inhibitor significantly blocked high-PA FSN effects on barrier. The effects on barrier were diminished by pharmacological or siRNA inhibition of protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2). Patients with high-PA IBS had lower occludin expression, wider TJs on biopsies and reduced microbial diversity than patients with low PA. Mice humanised with high-PA IBS microbiota had greater in vivo permeability than those with low-PA microbiota. Conclusion A subset of patients with IBS, especially in PI-IBS, has substantially high faecal PA, greater symptoms, impaired barrier and reduced microbial diversity. Commensal microbiota affects luminal PA that can influence host barrier function. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.

AB  - Background: Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction is involved in the development and pathogenesis of intestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease. This study was performed to evaluate the ability of total flavonoid extract from hawthorn (TFH) to improve TNF-a-evoked intestinal epithelial barrier deficit. Material/Methods: Caco-2 cells monolayers were exposed to TNF-a in different concentrations of TFH. Intestinal epithelial barrier function was evaluated using epithelial permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Results: Our findings showed that TFH alleviated the increase of paracellular permeability and the decline of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) evoked by TNF-a. Additionally, 24-h pre-incubation with TFH inhibited TNF-a-evoked secretion of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and IL-1b). Furthermore, TFH inhibited TNF-a-evoked overexpression of pMLC and MLCK and alleviated breakdown of TJs protein (ZO-1 and occludin). The activations of Elk-1 and NFkBp65 were inhibited by TFH pre-incubation. Conclusions: TFH can alleviate TNF-a-evoked intestinal epithelial barrier deficit via the NFkBp65-mediated MLCK-MLC signaling pathway. © Med Sci Monit.

AB  - Brain ghrelin plays a role in gastrointestinal functions. Among them, ghrelin acts centrally to stimulate gastrointestinal motility and induce visceral antinociception. Intestinal barrier function, one of important gastrointestinal functions, is also controlled by the central nervous system. Little is, however, known about a role of central ghrelin in regulation of intestinal permeability. The present study was performed to clarify whether brain ghrelin is also involved in regulation of intestinal barrier function and its mechanism. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in rats. Intracisternal injection of ghrelin dose-dependently abolished increased colonic permeability in response to LPS while intraperitoneal injection of ghrelin at the same dose or intracisternal injection of des-acyl-ghrelin failed to block it. Carbachol potently attenuated LPS-induced intestinal hyperpermeability, and atropine or bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy prevented the improvement of intestinal hyperpermeability by central ghrelin. Intracisternal (D-Lys3)-GHRP-6, a selective ghrelin receptor antagonist, significantly blocked improvement of intestinal barrier function by intravenously administered 2-deoxy-D-glucose, central vagal stimulant. Intracisternal injection of orexin 1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 blocked intracisternal ghrelin-induced improvement of colonic hyperpermeability. These results suggest that exogenously administered or endogenously released ghrelin acts centrally to improve a disturbed intestinal barrier function through orexinergic signaling and the vagal cholinergic pathway. Central ghrelin may be involved in the pathophysiology and be a novel therapeutic option in not only gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome but also non-gastrointestinal diseases associated with the altered intestinal permeability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The gut barrier has been recognized as being of relevance in the pathogenesis of multiple different diseases ranging from inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory joint disease, fatty liver disease, and cardiometabolic disorders. The regulation of the gut barrier is, however, poorly understood. Especially, the role of food components such as sugars and complex carbohydrates has been discussed controversially in this respect. More recently, the intestinal microbiota has been proposed as an important regulator of the gut barrier. Whether the microbiota affects the barrier by its own, or whether food components such as carbohydrates mediate their effects through alterations of the microbiota composition or its metabolites, is still not clear. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge on this topic derived from both animal and human studies and discuss data for possible clinical impact. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Abstract: Studies so far conducted on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been focused mainly on the role of gut bacterial dysbiosis in modulating the intestinal permeability, inflammation, and motility, with consequences on the quality of life. Limited evidences showed a potential involvement of gut fungal communities. Here, the gut bacterial and fungal microbiota of a cohort of IBS patients have been characterized and compared with that of healthy subjects (HS). The IBS microbial community structure differed significantly compared to HS. In particular, we observed an enrichment of bacterial taxa involved in gut inflammation, such as Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus, Fusobacteria, Gemella, and Rothia, as well as depletion of health-promoting bacterial genera, such as Roseburia and Faecalibacterium. Gut microbial profiles in IBS patients differed also in accordance with constipation. Sequence analysis of the gut mycobiota showed enrichment of Saccharomycetes in IBS. Culturomics analysis of fungal isolates from feces showed enrichment of Candida spp. displaying from IBS a clonal expansion and a distinct genotypic profiles and different phenotypical features when compared to HS of Candida albicans isolates. Alongside the well-characterized gut bacterial dysbiosis in IBS, this study shed light on a yet poorly explored fungal component of the intestinal ecosystem, the gut mycobiota. Our results showed a differential fungal community in IBS compared to HS, suggesting potential for new insights on the involvement of the gut mycobiota in IBS. Key points: • Comparison of gut microbiota and mycobiota between IBS and healthy subjects • Investigation of cultivable fungi in IBS and healthy subjects • Candida albicans isolates result more virulent in IBS subjects compared to healthy subjects © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic intestinal disorder accompanied by low-grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Several studies have indicated that Lactobacillus supplementation can help to alleviate IBS symptoms and that these effects are strain-specific. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the key physiological characteristics and functional genes contributing to the IBS-alleviating effects of Lactobacillus. An IBS model was established by subjecting C57BL/6 mice to Citrobacter rodentium ingestion and water avoidance stress. Lactobacillus strains with different physiological characteristics were administered to mice intragastrically for 4 weeks (5 × 109 CFU/0.2 mL per mouse per day). Indicators of colonic inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, and gut microbiota were also evaluated. Finally, differences in functional genes between Lactobacillus strains were analyzed by a comparative genomic analysis, and the relationships between the physiological characteristics, functional genes, and IBS-alleviating effects of the strains were quantified using correlation analysis. Among the eight tested Lactobacillus strains, only Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610 significantly inhibited the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, PAR-2, and mast cell tryptase. L. plantarum CCFM8610 also significantly increased the intestinal barrier function, inhibited visceral hypersensitivity symptoms, and modulated the gut microbiota diversity and composition. The correlation analysis of factors associated with the IBS-alleviating effects of Lactobacillus revealed the ability to synthesize conjugated linoleic acid as the most strongly associated physiological characteristic and COG1028-related genes as the most strongly associated functional genes. In conclusion, these findings can facilitate the rapid screening of Lactobacillus strains with IBS-alleviating effects and lay a foundation for studies of the related mechanisms. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC. is a widely used traditional herb that is well known for treating spleen deficiency and diarrhea. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is caused by cold and dampness, resulting in diarrhea and abdominal pain. Nevertheless, the effect and mechanism of Atractylodes on IBS-D are still unclear. Aim of the study: This study was designed to confirm the therapeutic effect of Atractylodes lanceolata oil (AO) in a rat model of IBS-D, and to determine the mechanisms by which AO protects against the disease. Materials and methods: The chemical components in AO were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The expression levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and surfactant protein (SP) in serum and colon tissue were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to elucidate the mechanism of action of AO toward inflammation and the intestinal barrier in a rat model of IBS-D. Results: The 15 chemical substances of the highest concentration in AO were identified using GC-MS. AO was effective against IBS-D in the rat model, in terms of increased body weight, diarrhea grade score, levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), aquaporin 3 (AQP3), and aquaporin 8 (AQP8), and reduced fecal moisture content, levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), 5-HT, VIP, and SP, while also reducing intestinal injury, as observed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. In addition, the results indicated that AO increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of stem cell factor (SCF) and c-kit and enhanced the levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, as well as decreased the levels of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and inhibited the phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 (p-MLC2). Conclusions: AO was found to be efficacious in the rat model of IBS-D. AO inhibited the SCF/c-kit pathway, thereby reducing inflammation and protecting against intestinal barrier damage via the MLCK/MLC2 pathway. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To investigate effects of berberine exerts on A20 expression and regulation of intestinal epithelial tight junctions via the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway in Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D). C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and A20 IEC-KO mice (48 each) were randomly divided into normal control (NC), model control (MC), rifaximin and berberine groups (12 mice per group). An experimental model of IBS-D was established using 4% acetic acid and evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. rifaximin and berberine mice were treated with rifaximin and berberine, respectively. Intestinal epithelial space of WT berberine mice improved more than A20 IEC-KO berberine mice compared to MC mice. WT berberine mice exhibited greater expression of A20 compared with MC mice(P < 0.01). TNF-α, NF-kB p65, MLCK, MLC, TRAF6 and RIP1 levels in A20 IEC-KO and WT berberine mice were all decreased compared to MC mice(P all<0.05). NF-κB p65, MLCK and TRAF6 levels were increased in A20 IEC-KO berberine mice as compared to WT berberine mice (P all<0.05). Intestinal epithelial levels of occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1 and F-actin increased in all berberine mice (P all<0.01-0.05), while occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 levels were lower in A20 IEC-KO berberine mice(P < 0.05). Berberine downregulates abnormal activation of the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway by upregulating expression of A20 in a mouse model of IBS-D, thereby protecting intestinal epithelial tight junctions and repairing the damage IBS-D causes to the intestinal epithelial barrier. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a multifactorial chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by inflammation and immune response. In this context, NLRP3 over-activation is associated with a breakdown of enteric-immune balance related to IBS-D. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the inflammasome inhibitor, BAY 11-7082, in a rat model of IBS-D. Syndrome was induced by intracolonic instillation of 1 mL 4% acetic acid at 8 cm proximal to the anus for 30 s and sacrificed 2 weeks after IBS-D induction. BAY 11-7082 (10 and 30 mg/kg) was administered daily by oral gavage. The results obtained showed that the treatment with BAY 11-7082 (30 mg/kg) significantly reduced tissue injury characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration, and loss of colon structure. We demonstrated that BAY 11-7082 treatment inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NF-kB translocation, reducing inflammatory mediators. Moreover, treatment with BAY 11-7082 restored tight junction alteration following IBS-D induction and reduced the restraint stress. Taken together, our data demonstrate that IBS-D induced NLRP3 inflammasome pathway activation, accompanied by the production of proinflammatory response. The modulation of the inflammosome pathway with BAY 11-7082 inhibitor significantly reduced pathological signs of IBS-D, therefore, can be considered a valuable strategy to reduce the development of IBS-D. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Scope: Since epithelial barrier dysfunction has been associated with gluten and fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyols (FODMAPs), the effect of alterations in FODMAP a gluten intake on epithelial barrier function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who self-reported gluten sensitivity. Methods and results: Circulating concentrations of markers of epithelial injury (syndecan-1 and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein) and bacterial translocation (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and soluble CD14) are measured while consuming habitual gluten-free diet and during blinded challenges with gluten or placebo on a background of low FODMAP intake. In 33 patients, only syndecan-1 concentrations during their habitual diet are elevated (median 43 ng mL−1) compared with 23 ng mL−1 in 49 healthy subjects (p < 0.001). On a low FODMAP diet, symptoms are reduced and levels of syndecan-1 (but not other markers) fell by a median 3335% (p < 0.001) irrespective of whether gluten is present or not. Conclusion: Gluten ingestion has no specific effect on epithelial integrity or symptoms in this cohort, but reducing FODMAP intake concomitantly reduces symptoms and reverses apparent colonic epithelial injury. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of populations self-reporting gluten sensitivity and implicate FODMAPs in colonic injury in IBS. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is highly prevalent and presents a clinical challenge. Gelsectan is a medical device containing xyloglucan (XG), pea protein and tannins (PPT) from grape seed extract, and xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS), which act together to protect and reinforce the intestinal barrier. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XG + PPT + XOS in patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Methods: In this double-blind study, 60 patients were randomly assigned to receive XG + PPT + XOS or placebo for 28 days, then crossed over to the alternative treatment. Patients were followed for 60 days. Results: At Day 28, a significantly higher proportion of patients starting treatment with XG + PPT + XOS than placebo (87 vs 0%; p = 0.0019) presented normal stools (Bristol Stool Form Scale type 3−4). At Day 56, a significantly higher proportion of patients who crossed over to XG + PPT + XOS than placebo (93% vs 23%; p = 0.0001) presented normal stools. In the group allocated to receive XG + PPT + XOS after placebo, benefits of XG + PPT + XOS were maintained during follow-up. Subjective assessments of abdominal pain, bloating, quality of life and general health indicated significant improvement with XG + PPT + XOS over placebo. There were no related adverse events. Conclusion: XG + PPT + XOS effectively controlled diarrhoea and alleviated clinical symptoms in patients with IBS-D, and was well tolerated. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background & Aims: Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a technique that permits real-time detection and quantification of changes in intestinal tissues and cells, including increases in intraepithelial lymphocytes and fluid extravasation through epithelial leaks. Using CLE analysis of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), we found that more than half have responses to specific food components. Exclusion of the defined food led to long-term symptom relief. We used the results of CLE to detect reactions to food in a larger patient population and analyzed duodenal biopsy samples and fluid from patients to investigate mechanisms of these reactions. Methods: In a prospective study, 155 patients with IBS received 4 challenges with each of 4 common food components via the endoscope, followed by CLE, at a tertiary medical center. Classical food allergies were excluded by negative results from immunoglobulin E serology analysis and skin tests for common food antigens. Duodenal biopsy samples and fluid were collected 2 weeks before and immediately after CLE and were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblots. Results from patients who had a response to food during CLE (CLE+) were compared with results from patients who did not have a reaction during CLE (CLE–) or healthy individuals (controls). Results: Of the 108 patients who completed the study, 76 were CLE+ (70%), and 46 of these (61%) reacted to wheat. CLE+ patients had a 4-fold increase in prevalence of atopic disorders compared with controls (P =.001). Numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes were significantly higher in duodenal biopsy samples from CLE+ vs CLE– patients or controls (P =.001). Expression of claudin-2 increased from crypt to villus tip (P <.001) and was up-regulated in CLE+ patients compared with CLE– patients or controls (P =.023). Levels of occludin were lower in duodenal biopsy samples from CLE+ patients vs controls (P =.022) and were lowest in villus tips (P <.001). Levels of messenger RNAs encoding inflammatory cytokines were unchanged in duodenal tissues after CLE challenge, but eosinophil degranulation increased, and levels of eosinophilic cationic protein were higher in duodenal fluid from CLE+ patients than controls (P =.03). Conclusions: In a CLE analysis of patients with IBS, we found that more than 50% of patients could have nonclassical food allergy, with immediate disruption of the intestinal barrier upon exposure to food antigens. Duodenal tissues from patients with responses to food components during CLE had immediate increases in expression of claudin-2 and decreases in occludin. CLE+ patients also had increased eosinophil degranulation, indicating an atypical food allergy characterized by eosinophil activation. © 2019 AGA Institute

AB  - Background & Aims: Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) and in the intestinal barrier are putative risk factors for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to identify differentially expressed colonic mucosal miRNAs, their targets in IBS compared to healthy controls (HCs), and putative downstream pathways. Methods: Twenty-nine IBS patients (15 IBS with constipation [IBS-C], 14 IBS with diarrhea [IBS-D]), and 15 age-matched HCs underwent sigmoidoscopy with biopsies. A nCounter array was used to assess biopsy specimen-associated miRNA levels. A false discovery rate (FDR) < 10% was considered significant. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to validate differentially expressed genes. To assess barrier function, trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and dextran flux assays were performed on Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells that were transfected with miRNA-inhibitors or control inhibitors. Protein expression of barrier function associated genes was confirmed using western blots. Results: Four out of 247 miRNAs tested were differentially expressed in IBS compared to HCs (FDR < 10%). Real-time PCR validation suggested decreased levels of miR-219a-5p and miR-338-3p in IBS (P =.026 and P =.004), and IBS-C (P =.02 and P =.06) vs. HCs as the strongest associations. Inhibition of miR-219a-5p resulted in altered expression of proteasome/barrier function genes. Functionally, miR-219a-5p inhibition enhanced the permeability of intestinal epithelial cells as TEER was reduced (25-50%, P <.05) and dextran flux was increased (P <.01). Additionally, inhibition of miR-338-3p in cells caused alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway genes. Conclusion: Two microRNAs that potentially affect permeability and visceral nociception were identified to be altered in IBS patients. MiR-219a-5p and miR-338-3p potentially alter barrier function and visceral hypersensitivity via neuronal and MAPK signaling and could be therapeutic targets in IBS. © 2021 AGA Institute

AB  - Background: A Giardia outbreak in Bergen, Norway, caused postinfectious functional gastrointestinal disorders (PI-FGIDs). Despite the devastating effects of this outbreak, it presented a unique chance to investigate the implication on the dysregulation of genetic pathways in PI-FGID. Methods: We performed the first comparative expression profiling of miRNAs and their potential target genes in microdissected rectal biopsies from 20 Giardia-induced PI-FGID patients vs 18 healthy controls by nCounter analysis. Subsequently, candidates were validated on protein level by immunostaining. Key Results: miRNA profiling on rectal biopsy samples from 5 diarrhea-predominant PI-IBS cases compared to 10 healthy controls revealed differential expression in the epithelial layer. The top five regulated miRNAs were implicated in GI disease, inflammatory response, and immunological disease. Subsequently, these miRNAs and 100 potential mRNA targets were examined in 20 PI-FGID cases and 18 healthy controls in both the mucosal epithelium and the lamina propria. Although deregulation of the selected miRNAs could not be verified in the larger sample set, mRNAs involved in barrier function were downregulated in the epithelium. Pro-inflammatory genes and genes implicated in epigenetic modifications were upregulated in the lamina propria. Immunostaining for selected candidates on 17 PI-FGID cases and 16 healthy controls revealed increased tryptase levels as well as a decreased and aberrant subcellular expression of occludin. Conclusions and Inferences: Genes relevant to immune and barrier function as well as stress response and epigenetic modulation are differentially expressed in PI-FGIDs and may contribute to disease manifestation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Decreased serum vitamin D (VD) levels have been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). VD can also modulate the intestinal barrier. Given the link between the GI barrier’s alterations and diet, attention has aroused the positive effects of the Low FODMAP Diet (LFD) on IBS patients’ symptom profile. We evaluated the GI symptoms and the urinary and circulating markers of GI barrier function, the markers of inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis in 36 IBS patients with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) (5 men and 31 women, 43.1 ± 1.7 years) categorized for their circulating VD levels in low (L-VD) and normal (N-VD) (cutoff = 20 ng/mL). Evaluations were performed before and after 12 weeks of LFD. At the baseline, L-VD patients showed a significantly worse symptom profile and altered small intestinal permeability (s-IP) than N-VD. After LFD, a significant increase in the circulating VD levels in both the subgroups and a significant improvement of s-IP in L-VD patients occurred. Finally, VD levels negatively correlated with the symptom score and fecal zonulin. These data highlight the close relationship between VD and the intestinal barrier and support their involvement in IBS-D pathophysiology. Moreover, the potentially positive role of LFD in the management of IBS-D was confirmed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background & aims: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is more prevalent in women. Vitamin D deficiency and hormonal disorders are also prevalent in Iranian women, and may influence the severity of clinical outcomes mediated by microinflammation, oxidative stress and intestinal permeability pathways. Our objective was to investigate the effects of co-administration of soy and vitamin D on some inflammatory, antioxidant and gut permeability markers in women with IBS. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, women (18–75 years of age) were randomly allocated into four groups to receive soy isoflavones (40 mg/day), cholecalciferol (50,000 IU/15 days), both soy isoflavones and cholecalciferol, or placebo for six weeks. The outcomes were plasma inflammatory markers, antioxidant status and fecal protease activity at week 0 and week 6. Results: After the intervention, plasma inflammatory markers and fecal protease activity were reduced significantly in all treatment groups compared to the placebo group; however, there was no significant effect on antioxidant status. Conclusion: This study suggests combined supplementation of soy isoflavones and active vitamin D can improve some biochemical parameters regarding inflammation and intestinal permeability of IBS in women.

AB  - The developmental period constitutes a critical window of sensitivity to stress. Indeed, early-life adversity increases the risk to develop psychiatric diseases, but also gastrointestinal disorders such as the irritable bowel syndrome at adulthood. In the past decade, there has been huge interest in the gut-brain axis, especially as regards stress-related emotional behaviours. Animal models of early-life adversity, in particular, maternal separation (MS) in rodents, demonstrate lasting deleterious effects on both the gut and the brain. Here, we review the effects of MS on both systems with a focus on stress-related behaviours. In addition, we discuss more recent findings showing the impact of gut-directed interventions, including nutrition with pre- and probiotics, illustrating the role played by gut microbiota in mediating the long-term effects of MS. Overall, preclinical studies suggest that nutritional approaches with pro- and prebiotics may constitute safe and efficient strategies to attenuate the effects of early-life stress on the gut-brain axis. Further research is required to understand the complex mechanisms underlying gut-brain interaction dysfunctions after early-life stress as well as to determine the beneficial impact of gut-directed strategies in a context of early-life adversity in human subjects.

AB  - Objectives: Impaired intestinal barrier function has been demonstrated in the pathophysiology of diarrheapredominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). This study aimed to describe the intestinal ultrastructural findings in the intestinal mucosal layer of IBS-D patients. Methods: In total, 10 healthy controls and 10 IBS-D patients were analyzed in this study. The mucosa of each patient's rectosigmoid colon was first assessed by confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE); next, biopsied specimens of these sites were obtained. Intestinal tissues of IBS-D patients and healthy volunteers were examined to observe cellular changes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: CLE showed no visible epithelial damage or inflammatory changes in the colonic mucosa of IBS-D compared with healthy volunteers. On transmission electron microscopic examination, patients with IBS-D displayed a larger apical intercellular distance with a higher proportion of dilated (>20 nm) intercellular junctional complexes, which was indicative of impaired mucosal integrity. In addition, microvillus exfoliation, extracellular vesicle as well as increased presence of multivesicular bodies were visible in IBS-D patients. Single epithelial cells appeared necrotic, as characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization, cytoplasmic swelling, and presence of autolysosome. A significant association between bowel habit, frequency of abdominal pain, and enlarged intercellular distance was found. Conclusion: This study showed ultrastructural alterations in the architecture of intestinal epithelial cells and intercellular junctional complexes in IBS-D patients, potentially representing a pathophysiological mechanism in IBS-D. © 2019 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

AB  - Background and Aim: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating are frequent in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like disorders, although little is known about their intestinal ultrastructural alterations. The aim of the present study was to study duodenal biopsies from IBS-like patients to find ultrastructural alterations. Materials and Methods: Study design: descriptive comparative pilot study. Thirty outpatients (9 male and 21 female; median age 37.7 years; range, 20 to 65 years) complaining of IBS-like symptoms were enrolled between January 2015 to May 2019 and were divided into 6 groups, each equally consisting of 5 patients: (A) untreated celiac disease (uCD); (B) treated celiac disease (tCD); (C) wheat allergy (WA); (D) Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS); (E) Nickel allergic contact mucositis (Ni ACM); (F) controls affected by GERD. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) morphological characteristics were: microvilli length, intermicrovillar distance, junctional complexes (JC) gap width, autophagic bodies, apoptosis, altered mitochondria, lipid/chylomicron droplets, and mast cells. Regarding JC, we focused on tight junctions (TJ), adherens junctions (AJ), and desmosomes. Results: Major alterations in microvilli length and intermicrovillar distance have been observed in the subjects affected by uCD. Microvilli of tCD patients showed marked recovery after adequate GFD, although not comparable to controls. Intermediate microvillar alterations were instead observed in NCGS and Ni ACM, while characteristics of WA subjects appeared more similar to tCD. Regarding JC, TJ did not show significant differences between all groups studied, including controls. The AJ were significantly more dilated in all groups compared to controls, while no significant differences were found between the pathological groups. The distance between desmosomes was greater in uCD, NCGS, and Ni ACM than in tCD, WA, and controls. Finally, intracellular alterations have been detected in most of the groups studied although they seemed more unspecific. Conclusions: TEM analysis confirmed damages to the intestinal barrier and defense mechanisms by enterocytes in IBS-like patients, probably linked to low-grade inflammation or adverse reactions triggered by food allergens, heavy metals, or other unknown. On the other hand, our study needs confirmation and further investigations with larger populations to facilitate diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of IBS-like disorders in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Barrier dysfunction is recognized as a pathogenic factor in ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but it is unclear to what extent the factors related to barrier dysfunction are disease-specific. The aim of this study was to compare these aspects in UC patients in remission, IBS patients, and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: Colonic biopsies were collected from 13 patients with UC in remission, 15 patients with IBS-mixed, and 15 HCs. Ulcerative colitis patients had recently been treated for relapse, and biopsies were taken from earlier inflamed areas. Biopsies were mounted in Ussing chambers for measurements of intestinal paracellular permeability to 51chromium (Cr)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). In addition, biopsies were analyzed for mast cells and eosinophils by histological procedures, and plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was assessed by ELISA. Results: Ussing chamber experiments revealed an increased 51Cr-EDTA permeability in UC and IBS (P < 0.05). The 51Cr-EDTA permeability was higher in UC compared with IBS (P < 0.005). There were increased numbers of mucosal mast cells and eosinophils in UC and IBS and more eosinophils in UC compared with IBS (P < 0.05). Also, increased extracellular granule content was found in UC compared with HCs (P < 0.05). The 51Cr-EDTA permeability correlated significantly with eosinophils in all groups. Plasma TNF-α concentration was higher in UC compared with IBS and HCs (P < 0.0005). Conclusions: Results indicate a more permeable intestinal epithelium in inactive UC and IBS compared with HCs. Ulcerative colitis patients, even during remission, demonstrate a leakier barrier compared with IBS. Both eosinophil numbers and activation state might be involved in the increased barrier function seen in UC patients in remission. © 2020 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to determine whether patients with IBS displayed altered mucosal mast cell (MC) numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves compared with healthy subjects (HS) and whether these MC characteristics correlated with IBS symptoms, elements of the epithelial barrier, or visceral sensitivity. Methods: Mucosal MC characteristics were determined using immunoassay. IBS symptoms, gene expression of elements of the epithelial barrier, fecal serine protease activity, and visceral sensitivity were assessed. Key Results: The MC numbers per mm2 were 2.0 (0.0-6.0) in patients with IBS (n = 43) and 3.5 (1.1-9.1) in HS (n = 20, P =.26). Of these, MCs were 0.0 (0.0-20) % vs 3.1 (0.0-18) % (P =.76) in IBS and HS, respectively, in co-localization with nerve fibers. MC characteristics were equivalent in the different IBS subtypes. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified two distinct groups among patients with IBS: MC high (higher MC numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves) and MC low (lower MC numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves). The MC high and MC low groups could not be discriminated with regard to IBS symptoms, parameters of visceral sensitivity, gene expression of elements of the epithelial barrier, and fecal protease activity. Conclusion and Inferences: There was no evidence of increased infiltration or altered localization of MCs in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS. These MC characteristics were not linked to global IBS symptoms or mucosal expression of elements of the epithelial barrier. These findings indicate that quantity and location of mucosal MCs are factors not involved in the pathophysiology of IBS. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Functional abdominal bloating and distension (FABD) are common and frequent symptoms in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. FABD is characterized by recurrent abdominal fullness and bloating. The pathophysiology of FABD is still unclear. However, the plausible mechanisms involved are small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), imbalance of gut micro-biota, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal permeability alteration, and disruption of intestinal barrier function. Thus, the creation of a barrier on the wall of the intestine could represent an alternative therapeutic strategy to prevent FABD. This study aimed to investigate the effect of two natural substances, Xyloglucan (XG) and Pea-protein (PP), known for their mucosal-protective properties, in an in vivo model of Partial restraint-stress (PRS). Our results showed that the pre-treatment with a product containing XG and PP in stressed-rats was able to reduce the number of abdominal contractions and visceral hypersensitivity. Moreover, XG and PP were able to reduce intestinal permeability alteration, restoring tight-junctions (TJs) expression and decreased the lactulose–mannitol ratio, a quantitative marker used to measure intestinal permeability, compared to PRS-group. In conclusion, the data obtained revealed that the product containing XG and PP was able to restore the normal intestinal-barrier function; therefore, it could be considered a therapeutic strategy to manage FABD. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) occurs commonly, is difficult to treat, and frequently recurs. Bovine colostrum (BC) and chicken eggs contain immunoglobulins and other components that possess antimicrobial, immunoregulatory, and growth factor activities; however, it is not known if they have the ability to reduce injury caused by the presence of bacteria associated with SIBO (Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Proteus) and infectious diarrhea (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella). We examined the effects of BC, egg, or the combination, on bacterial growth and bacteria-induced changes in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and bacterial translocation across confluent Caco-2 monolayers. BC, egg, or the combination did not affect bacterial growth. Adding bacteria to monolayers reduced TEER and (with minor variations among species) increased bacterial translocation, increased monolayer apoptosis (increased caspase-3 and Baxα, reduced Bcl2), increased intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and reduced cell adhesion molecules zonulin1 (ZO1) and claudin-1. BC, egg, or the combination reduced these effects (all p < 0.01) and caused additional increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70) expression. We conclude that BC ± egg strength-ens mucosal integrity against a battery of bacteria relevant for SIBO and for infectious diarrhea. Oral BC ± egg may have clinical value for these conditions, especially SIBO where eradication of precipitating organisms may be difficult to achieve. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The role of protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) in the pathogenesis of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not well defined. Aims: To investigate the role of PAR-2-mediated visceral hypersensitivity in a post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) mouse model. Methods: T. spiralis-infected PI-IBS mouse model was used. Fecal serine protease activity and intestinal mast cells were evaluated. Intestinal permeability was assessed by urine lactulose/mannitol ratio, and colonic expressions of PAR-2 and tight junction (TJ) proteins were examined by Western blot. Intestinal immune profile was assessed by measuring Th (T helper) 1/Th2 cytokine expression. Visceral sensitivity was evaluated by abdominal withdrawal reflex in response to colorectal distention. Results: Colonic PAR-2 expression as well as fecal serine protease activity and intestinal mast cell counts were elevated in PI-IBS compared to the control mice. Decreased colonic TJ proteins expression, increased lactulose/mannitol ratio, elevated colonic Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio, and visceral hypersensitivity were observed in PI-IBS compared to the control mice. Administration of PAR-2 agonist in control mice demonstrated similar changes observed in PI-IBS mice, while PAR-2 antagonist normalized the increased intestinal permeability and reduced visceral hypersensitivity observed in PI-IBS mice. Conclusions: PAR-2 activation increases intestinal permeability leading to immune activation and visceral hypersensitivity in PI-IBS mouse model. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Our previous report determined that miR-144 is a key regulator of intestinal epithelial permeability in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) rats. Recent evidence has shown that lactobacilli play an important role in the relief of IBS-D symptoms. However, few studies have addressed the mechanisms by which microRNAs and lactobacilli exert their beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial permeability. Hence, to elucidate whether miRNAs and lactobacilli play roles in intestinal epithelial barrier regulation, we compared miRNA expression levels in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) under Lactobacillus casei (L. casei LC01) treatment. IECs and L. casei LC01 were co-cultured and then subjected to microRNA microarray assay. qRT-PCR, western blot and ELISA were used to detect the expression of occludin (OCLN) and zonula occludens 1 (ZO1/TJP1). The interaction between miRNAs and L. casei LC01 acting in IECs was investigated through transfection of RNA oligoribonucleotides and pcDNA 3.1 plasmid. The results are as follows: 1) L. casei LC01 decreased the expression of miR-144 and FD4 and promoted OCLN and ZO1 expression in IECs; 2) L. casei LC01 enhanced the barrier function of IECs via downregulation of miR-144 and upregulation of OCLN and ZO1; 3) Under L. casei LC01 treatment, OCLN and ZO1 overexpression could partially eliminate the promoting effect of miR-144 on intestinal permeability in IECs. Our results demonstrate that L. casei LC01 regulates intestinal permeability of IECs through miR-144 targeting of OCLN and ZO1. L. casei LC01 can be a possible therapeutic target for managing dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Copyright© 2020 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder, which still lacks effective therapy. We aimed to investigate the effects of a novel formulation of Bifidobacterium longum BB536 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 with vitamin B6 (LBB) on symptoms, intestinal permeability, cultivable bacteria and metabolome in IBS subjects. Materials and methods: Twenty-five IBS patients (Rome IV criteria) (M:F = 8:17; age 48 years ± 11 SD) were randomized to treatment (LBB) or placebo (one month each) in a crossover randomized double-blind controlled trial. Symptoms, intestinal habits, disease severity, intestinal permeability and intestinal microbiota were analysed at 0, 30, 45 and 60 days. Results: Percentage decrease from baseline of abdominal pain (−48.8% vs −3.5%), bloating (−36.35% vs +7.35%) and severity of disease (−30.1% vs −0.4%) was significantly (P <.0001) greater with LBB than placebo, respectively. In IBS-D patients, the improvement from baseline of Bristol score was more consistent with LBB (from 6 ± 0.4 to 4.3 ± 1.1, P <.00001) than placebo (from 6.2 ± 0.7 to 5.3 ± 1.1, P =.04). In IBS-C patients, Bristol score tended to improve from baseline after LBB (2.6 ± 1.1 vs 3.2 ± 0.5, P =.06). LBB significantly improved the percentage of sucralose recovery (colonic permeability) (1.86 ± 0.1 vs 1.1 ± 0.2, P =.01). During treatment, presumptive lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, relative abundance of propanoic, butanoic, pentanoic acids and hydrocarbons increased, while phenol decreased. Conclusions: The novel formulation of B. longum BB536 and L. rhamnosus HN001 with B6 vitamin improves symptoms and severity of disease, restores intestinal permeability and gut microbiota in IBS patients. © 2020 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterised by gastrointestinal (GI) and psychological symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, and somatization). Depression and anxiety, but not somatization, have already been associated with altered intestinal barrier function, increased LPS, and dysbiosis. The study aimed to investigate the possible link between somatization and intestinal barrier in IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) patients. Methods: Forty-seven IBS-D patients were classified as having low somatization (LS = 19) or high somatization (HS = 28) according to the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), (cut-off score = 63). The IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaires were administered to evaluate GI symptoms. The intestinal barrier function was studied by the lactulose/mannitol absorption test, faecal and serum zonulin, serum intestinal fatty-acid binding protein, and diamine oxidase. Inflammation was assessed by assaying serum Interleukins (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), and tumour necrosis factor-α. Dysbiosis was assessed by the urinary concentrations of indole and skatole and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS). All data were analysed using a non-parametric test. Results: The GI symptoms profiles were significantly more severe, both as a single symptom and as clusters of IBS-SSS and GSRS, in HS than LS patients. This finding was associated with impaired small intestinal permeability and increased faecal zonulin levels. Besides, HS patients showed significantly higher IL-8 and lowered IL-10 concentrations than LS patients. Lastly, circulating LPS levels and the urinary concentrations of indole were higher in HS than LS ones, suggesting a more pronounced imbalance of the small intestine in the former patients. Conclusions: IBS is a multifactorial disorder needing complete clinical, psychological, and biochemical evaluations.

AB  - Background: The association between fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome is well-established. Alterations in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in irritable bowel syndrome have been reported, however, this association is poorly understood in fibromyalgia. Our aim was to summarise the research reporting on the gastrointestinal microbiome and its biomarkers in people with fibromyalgia. Methods: A systematic review of published original research reporting on the gastrointestinal microbiota and its biomarkers in adults with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia was undertaken. Results: From 4771 studies, 11 met our inclusion criteria and were separated into four main groups: papers reporting Helicobacter pylori; other gut bacterial markers; metabolomics and other biomarkers, which included intestinal permeability and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Conclusion: The results suggest there is a paucity of quality research in this area, with indications that the gut microbiota may play a role in fibromyalgia within the emerging field of the gut-musculoskeletal axis. Further investigations into the relationship between the gut microbiota, gut dysfunction and fibromyalgia are warranted. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: There is preliminary evidence to suggest curcumin can alleviate digestive symptoms in adults with self-reported digestive complaints and irritable bowel syndrome. However, in all these trials, curcumin was used as a component of a multi-herbal combination and there were consistent concerns associated with risk of bias in most studies. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of a curcumin extract (Curcugen™) on gastrointestinal symptoms, mood, and overall quality of life in adults presenting with self-reported digestive complaints. Moreover, to determine the potential therapeutic mechanisms of action associated with curcumin, its effects on intestinal microbiota and small intestinal bowel overgrowth (SIBO) were examined. Methods: In this 8-week, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 79 adults with self-reported digestive complaints were recruited and randomised to receive either a placebo or 500 mg of the curcumin extract, Curcugen™. Outcome measures included the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), intestinal microbial profile (16S rRNA), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale – 21 (DASS-21), Short Form-36 (SF-36), and SIBO breath test. Results: Based on self-report data collected from 77 participants, curcumin was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the GSRS total score compared to the placebo. There was also a greater reduction in the DASS-21 anxiety score. No other significant between-group changes in self-report data were identified. An examination of changes in the intestinal microbial profile and SIBO test revealed curcumin had no significant effect on these parameters. Curcumin was well-tolerated with no significant adverse events. Conclusions: The curcumin extract, Curcugen™, administered for 8 weeks at a dose of 500 mg once daily was associated with greater improvements in digestive complaints and anxiety levels in adults with self-reported digestive complaints. Compared to the placebo, there were no significant changes in intestinal microbiota or SIBO; however, further research using larger samples and testing methods that allow more detailed microbial analyses will be important. An investigation into other potential mechanisms associated with curcumin’s gastrointestinal-relieving effects will also be important such as examining its influence on the intestinal barrier function, inflammation, neurotransmitter activity, and visceral sensitivity.

AB  - Stress is a known trigger for flares of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, this process is not well understood. Here, we find that restraint stress in mice leads to signs of diarrhea, fecal dysbiosis, and a barrier defect via the opening of goblet-cell associated passages. Notably, stress increases host immunity to gut bacteria as assessed by immunoglobulin A (IgA)-bound gut bacteria. Stress-induced microbial changes are necessary and sufficient to elicit these effects. Moreover, similar to mice, many diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients from two cohorts display increased antibacterial immunity as assessed by IgA-bound fecal bacteria. This antibacterial IgA response in IBS-D correlates with somatic symptom severity and was distinct from healthy controls or IBD patients. These findings suggest that stress may play an important role in patients with IgA-associated IBS-D by disrupting the intestinal microbial community that alters gastrointestinal function and host immunity to commensal bacteria. © 2020 The Author(s); Rengarajan et al. show that stress in mice causes fecal dysbiosis, which is sufficient to induce diarrhea, intestinal barrier defect, and increased antibacterial IgA. IBS-D patients also display fecal dysbiosis and increased antibacterial IgA that is unique from healthy or IBD patients. This IgA response correlates with somatic symptom severity. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - So far, a comprehensive animal model that can mimic both the central and peripheral pathophysiological changes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is lacking. Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level and colonic 5-HT receptor 3A (5-HT3AR)/5-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired tight junction protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of 5-HT3AR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut microbiota. Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal microbiota transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS. In summary, we established a postinflammatory IBS model covering multifactorial pathophysiological changes, which may help to develop therapies that target specific IBS subtype.—Ma, J., Li, J., Qian, M., He, N., Cao, Y., Liu, Y., Wu, K., He, S.

AB  - BACKGROUND Fecal metabolites are associated with gut visceral sensitivity, mucosal immune function and intestinal barrier function, all of which have critical roles in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the metabolic profile and pathophysiology of IBS are still unclear. We hypothesized that altered profiles of fecal metabolites might be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D). AIM To investigate the fecal metabolite composition and the role of metabolites in IBS-D pathophysiology. METHODS Thirty IBS-D patients and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent clinical and psychological assessments, including the IBS Symptom Severity System (IBS-SSS), an Italian modified version of the Bowel Disease Questionnaire, the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Visceral Sensitivity Index. Visceral sensitivity to rectal distension was tested using high-resolution manometry system by the same investigator. Fecal metabolites, including amino acids and organic acids, were measured by targeted metabolomics approaches. Correlation analyses between these parameters were performed. RESULTS The patients presented with increased stool water content, more psychological symptoms and increased visceral hypersensitivity compared with the controls. In fecal metabolites, His [IBS-D: 0.0642 (0.0388, 0.1484), HC: 0.2636 (0.0780, 0.3966), P = 0.012], Ala [IBS-D: 0.5095 (0.2826, 0.9183), HC: 1.0118 (0.6135, 1.4335), P = 0.041], Tyr [IBS-D: 0.1024 (0.0173, 0.4527), HC: 0.5665 (0.2436, 1.3447), P = 0.018], Phe [IBS-D: 0.1511 (0.0775, 0.3248), HC: 0.3967 (0.1388, 0.7550), P = 0.028], and Trp [IBS-D: 0.0323 (0.0001, 0.0826), HC: 0.0834 (0.0170, 0.1759), P = 0.046] were decreased in IBS-D patients, but isohexanoate [IBS-D: 0.0127 (0.0060, 0.0246), HC: 0.0070 (0.0023, 0.0106), P = 0.028] was significantly increased. Only Tyr was mildly correlated with BSFS scores in all subjects (r = -0.347, P = 0.019). A possible potential biomarker panel was identified to correlate with IBS-SSS score (R2 Adjusted = 0.693, P < 0.001). In this regression model, the levels of Tyr, Val, hexanoate, fumarate, and pyruvate were significantly associated with the symptom severity of IBS-D. Furthermore, visceral sensation, including abdominal pain and visceral hypersensitivity, was correlated with isovalerate, valerate and isohexanoate. CONCLUSION Altered profiles of fecal metabolites may be one of the origins or exacerbating factors of symptoms in IBS-D via increasing visceral sensitivity. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier are crucial contributors to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and those are mediated via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)−Toll like receptor 4–pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. Phlorizin is an inhibitor of sodium-linked glucose transporters (SGLTs), and known to have anti-cytokine properties. Thus, we hypothesized that phlorizin may improve these gastrointestinal changes in IBS, and tested this hypothesis in rat IBS models, i.e., lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or CRF-induced visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. The visceral pain threshold in response to colonic balloon distention was estimated by abdominal muscle contractions by electromyogram, and colonic permeability was measured by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of phlorizin inhibited visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Phlorizin also blocked CRF-induced these gastrointestinal changes. Phlorizin is known to inhibit both SGLT1 and SGLT2, but intragastric administration of phlorizin may only inhibit SGLT1 because gut mainly expresses SGLT1. We found that intragastric phlorizin did not display any effects, but ipragliflozin, an orally active and selective SGLT2 inhibitor improved the gastrointestinal changes in the LPS model. Compound C, an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor and naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist reversed the effects of phlorizin. In conclusions, phlorizin improved visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in IBS models. These effects may result from inhibition of SGLT2, and were mediated via AMPK, NO and opioid pathways. Phlorizin may be effective for the treatment of IBS. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - INTRODUCTION:To determine the effect of peripheral CRF on intestinal barrier function in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pathophysiology has been linked to life stress, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and mast cell activation. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a major mediator of stress responses in the gastrointestinal tract, yet its role on IBS mucosal function remains largely unknown.METHODS:Intestinal response to sequential i.v. 5-mL saline solution (placebo) and CRF (100 g) was evaluated in 21 IBS-D and 17 healthy subjects (HSs). A 20-cm jejunal segment was perfused with an isosmotic solution and effluents collected at baseline, 30 minutes after placebo, and 60 minutes after CRF. We measured water flux, albumin output, tryptase release, stress hormones, cardiovascular and psychological responses, and abdominal pain. A jejunal biopsy was obtained for CRF receptor expression assessment.RESULTS:Water flux did not change after placebo in IBS-D and HS but significantly increased after CRF in IBS-D (P = 0.007). Basal luminal output of albumin was higher in IBS-D and increased further after CRF in IBS-D (P = 0.042). Basal jejunal tryptase release was higher in IBS-D, and CRF significantly increased it in both groups (P = 0.004), the response being higher in IBS-D than in HS (P = 0.0023). Abdominal pain worsened only in IBS-D after CRF and correlated with jejunal tryptase release, water flux, and albumin output. IBS-D displayed jejunal up-regulation of CRF2 and down-regulation of CRF1 compared with HS.DISCUSSION:Stress via CRF-driven mast cell activation seems to be relevant in the pathophysiology of IBS-D. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health.

AB  - Aim: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and stool irregularities. STW 5 has proven clinical efficacy in functional gastrointestinal disorders, including IBS, targeting pathways that suppress inflammation and protect the mucosa. Wnt signaling is known to modulate NF-kβ-dependent inflammatory cytokine production. This sparked the idea of evaluating the impact of STW 5 on the expression of inflammatory-response and Wnt/β catenin-target genes in an IBS-like model. Main methods: We used zebrafish and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment to model IBS-like conditions in vivo and in vitro and examined the effects of subsequent STW 5 treatment on the intestines of DSS-treated fish and primary cultured intestinal and neuronal cells. Gross gut anatomy, histology, and the expression of Wnt-signaling and cytokine genes were analyzed in treated animals and/or cells, and in controls. Key findings: DSS treatment up-regulated the expression of interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, wnt3a, and claudin-1 in explanted zebrafish gut. Subsequent STW 5 treatment abolished both the macroscopic signs of gut inflammation, DSS-induced mucosecretory phenotype, and normalized the DSS-induced upregulated expression of il10 and Wnt signaling genes, such as wnt3a and cldn1 in explanted zebrafish gut. Under inflammatory conditions, STW 5 downregulated the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes il1β, il6, il8, and tnfα while it upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory genes il10 and wnt3a in enteric neuronal cells in vitro. Significance: Wnt signaling could be a novel target for the anti-inflammatory and intestinal permeability-restoring effects of STW 5, possibly explaining its clinical efficacy in IBS. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Obesity and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are two major public health issues. Interestingly previous data report a marked increase of IBS prevalence in morbid obese subjects compared with non-obese subjects but underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Obesity and IBS share common intestinal pathophysiological mechanisms such as gut dysbiosis, intestinal hyperpermeability and low-grade inflammatory response. We thus aimed to evaluate the link between obesity and IBS using different animal models. Male C57Bl/6 mice received high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and were then submitted to water avoidance stress (WAS). In response to WAS, HFD mice exhibited higher intestinal permeability and plasma corticosterone concentration than non-obese mice. We were not able to reproduce a similar response both in ob/ob mice and in leptin-treated non-obese mice. In addition, metformin, a hypoglycemic agent, limited fasting glycaemia both in unstressed and WAS diet-induced obese mice but only partially restored colonic permeability in unstressed HFD mice. Metformin failed to improve intestinal permeability in WAS HFD mice. Finally, cecal microbiota transplantation from HFD mice in antibiotics-treated recipient mice did not reproduce the effects observed in stressed HFD mice. In conclusion, stress induced a more marked intestinal barrier dysfunction in diet-induced obese mice compared with non-obese mice that seems to be independent of leptin, glycaemia and gut microbiota. These data should be further confirmed and the role of the dietary composition should be studied. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a key etiologic factor of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Metformin improves intestinal barrier function, although the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully explained. This study evaluates the protective effect of metformin on colonic barrier integrity and explores the underlying cellular mechanisms. Methods: IBS-like rats were induced by maternal separation. Metformin was administered daily by gavage at 08:30, and rat pups were then separated from their mother. Visceral hyperalgesia and depression-like behaviors were evaluated by colorectal distension, sucrose preference tests, and forced swimming tests. Intestinal integrity was analyzed using sugar probes and transmission electron microscopy. Inflammatory factors and the levels of corticotropin-releasing factor were assessed by PCR and ELISA. The number of mast cells was evaluated by toluidine blue staining. Protein expression and localization were determined using Western blot and immunochemistry. Key Results: Metformin pretreatment (a) reduced visceral hypersensitivity to colorectal distension, immobility time and enhanced sucrose consumption; (b) decreased urine lactulose/mannitol ratio and sucralose output; (c) inhibited the dilation of tight junction and prevented claudin-4 translocation; (d) inhibited mast cell activation and downregulated the expression of IL-6, IL-18, tryptase, PAR-2, and ERK activation; (e) inhibited claudin-4 phosphorylation at serine sites and interactions between clau-4 and ZO-1. Conclusions & Inferences: Metformin may block mast cell activation to reduce PAR-2 expression and subsequently inhibit ERK activation and clau-4 phosphorylation at serine sites to normalize the interaction of clau-4 and ZO-1 and clau-4 distribution. Metformin may be clinically beneficial for patients with IBS or IBS-like symptoms. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is frequently silenced in lung, prostate, liver, stomach, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and other forms of human carcinomas. However, it is unclear regarding the role of CADM1 in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) that is the most common gastrointestinal diagnosis and may contribute to impaired intestinal barrier function. The aim of the present study is to explore the potential mechanism of CADM1 in regulating intestinal barrier function in IBS-D. A rat model with IBS-D induced by the combination method of mother-infant separation, acetic acid and restraint stress was initially established. The defecation frequency, faecal water content (FWC), total intestinal permeability, sIgA, endotoxin, D-lactic acid and diamine oxidase (DAO) were then measured. Next, positive expression of CADM1 protein was detected in distal colonic tissue of rats by immunohistochemistry. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in distal colonic mucosa, CADM1, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), STAT3, p-JAK1, p-STAT3, Claudin-1and Claudin-2 were evaluated using ELISA, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. IBS-D rats exhibited low CADM1 expression and activated STAT3 signaling pathway. Overexpression of CADM1 in rats was shown to increase Claudin-1 expression, while decreasing expression of STAT3, Claudin-2, TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, silencing of CADM1 or inhibition of the STAT3 signaling pathway was demonstrated to improve the intestinal barrier function. Our study provides evidence that CADM1 can potentially improve intestinal barrier function in rats with IBS-D by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several intestinal diseases, including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The present research was carried out to investigate the protective effect of total polysaccharides of adlay bran (TPA) on TNF-α-evoked epithelial barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells were treated with or without TPA in the absence or presence of TNF-α, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and Phenol Red flux were assayed to evaluate the intestinal epithelial barrier function. The results indicated that TPA suppressed the TNF-α-induced release of pro-inflammatory factors. Furthermore, TPA obviously assuaged both the increased paracellular permeability and the decrease of TEER in TNF-α-challenged Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, TPA obviously assuaged TNF-α-evoked up-regulation of IL-8 and IL-6 expression, down-regulation of occludin and ZO-3 expression, and markedly suppressed the activation and protein expression of NF-κB p65. Our results indicated that TPA assuages the TNF-α-evoked dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier by inhibiting the NF-κB p65-mediated inflammatory response. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: Studies have shown increased intestinal permeability in irritable bowel syndrome. Validating serum biomarkers for altered intestinal permeability in irritable bowel syndrome will facilitate research and pathophysiology-based therapy. Objective: To measure serum zonulin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and compare with healthy controls and celiac disease. Methods: Serum zonulin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (n = 50), diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (n = 50), celiac disease (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 42). Irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity was measured using the irritable bowel syndrome-symptom severity scale. Results: Patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome had higher zonulin levels compared with healthy controls (p = 0.006 and 0.009 respectively), which was comparable to those with active celiac disease. Although zonulin levels did not correlate with the overall irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity scale, it positively correlated with stool frequency per week (p = 0.03) and dissatisfaction with bowel habits (p = 0.007) in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome had lower intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels compared with celiac patients (p = 0.005 and p = 0.047 respectively). Conclusion: Serum zonulin is upregulated in irritable bowel syndrome and the levels are comparable to those in celiac disease. Zonulin levels correlated with severity of bowel habits in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels in irritable bowel syndrome patients were not increased suggesting no significant increase in enterocyte death. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - An impaired gut barrier, possibly leading to visceral hypersensitivity has been recently recognized to be one of the pivotal pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We previously showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and repeated water avoidance stress (WAS) induce visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability via pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling (rat IBS models). Although the precise mechanisms of action are unclear, imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, improves IBS symptoms, and also has anticytokine properties. In this study, we hypothesized that imipramine improves the gut barrier to ameliorate IBS symptoms. To test this hypothesis, we determined its effects on visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in rat IBS models. The visceral pain threshold in response to colonic balloon distention was electrophysiologically estimated by abdominal muscle contractions, and colonic permeability was measured by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in vivo. Subcutaneous imipramine injection (7, 20, 50 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced (1 mg/kg, subcutaneously) visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. Imipramine also blocked these gastrointestinal (GI) changes induced by CRF (50 μg/kg, intraperitoneally) or repeated WAS (1 h daily for 3 days). Yohimbine (an α2-adrenoceptors antagonist), sulpiride (a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist), and naloxone hydrochloride (an opioid receptor antagonist) reversed these effects of imipramine in the LPS model. Therefore, imipramine may block GI changes in IBS via α2-adrenoceptors, dopamine D2, and opioid signaling. The improvement in the gut barrier resulting in inhibition of visceral pain is considered a valid mechanism of imipramine to ameliorate IBS symptoms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenol compound present in plant foods. CGA is a differentially excreted gut microbial metabolite in fecal samples of irritable bowel syndrome model mice and normal control mice. Here, we aimed to clarify the protective effect of CGA on intestinal barrier function. We used Caco-2 cells to create an intestinal epithelial cell barrier model, and evaluated tight-junctional permeability with fluorescein isothiocyanate–dextran. We treated Caco-2 cells with lipopolysaccharide and CGA, and measured tight-junction protein expression, TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation, and proinflammatory cytokine levels. CGA blocked the NF-κB pathway by downregulating CD14 and p65, and preventing phospho-p65 from entering cell nuclei. CGA showed anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 production, and thereby restored intestinal epithelial tight-junction integrity. In conclusion, CGA was highly effective at preserving cell membrane integrity, and inhibited proinflammatory cytokine secretion by downregulating CD14 to block the NF-kB pathway. © 2021

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of Chang’an II Decoction (肠安 II 号方))-containing serum on intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in rats. Methods: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced injury of Caco-2 monolayers were established as an inflammatory model of human intestinal epithelium. Caco-2 monolayers were treated with blank serum and Chang’an II Decoction-containing serum that obtained from the rats which were treated with distilled water and Chang’an II Decoction intragastrically at doses of 0.49, 0.98, 1.96 g/(kg·d) for 1 week, respectively. After preparation of containing serum, cells were divided into the normal group, the model group, the Chang’an II-H, M, and L groups (treated with 30 ng/mL TNF-α and medium plus 10% high, middle-, and low-doses Chang’an II serum, respectively). Epithelial barrier function was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and permeability of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructure of tight junctions (TJs). Immunofluorescence of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin-1 and nuclear transcription factor-kappa p65 (NF-κ Bp65) were measured to determine the protein distribution. The mRNA expression of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of MLCK, myosin light chain (MLC) and p-MLC were determined by Western blot. Results: Chang’an II Decoction-containing serum significantly attenuated the TER and paracellular permeability induced by TNF-α. It alleviated TNF-α-induced morphological alterations in TJ proteins. The increases in MLCK mRNA and MLCK, MLC and p-MLC protein expressions induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited in the Chang’an II-H group. Additionally, Chang’an II Decoction significantly attenuated translocation of NF-κ Bp65 into the nucleus. Conclusion: High-dose Chang’an II-containing serum attenuates TNF-α-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. The underlying mechanism may be involved in inhibiting the MLCK-MLC phosphorylation signaling pathway mediated by NF-κ Bp65. © 2019, The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The intestinal barrier plays a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients and in preventing the entry of pathogenic microorganisms and toxic molecules. Several studies have shown a compromised intestinal barrier associated with low-grade inflammation in the small intestinal mucosa in celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly in IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). In light of these new data, IBS is no longer considered a functional disease but rather a heterogeneous syndrome that has yet to be carefully studied. Therefore, investigating the integrity and function of the intestinal barrier is now essential to improving knowledge of the pathophysiology of IBS-D and to improving the management of IBS-D patients. However, the study of the intestinal barrier must clarify some still unsolved methodological aspects and propose standardised assays before becoming a useful diagnostic tool. In this framework, this review will discuss data about the tests that noninvasively evaluate the integrity and functionality of the human intestinal barrier, paying particular attention to patients with IBS-D, in both clinical and research situations.  © 2020 Michele Linsalata et al.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a frequent problem associated with a significant socioeconomic implication. Increased gut permeability is an important pathophysiological mechanism. A medical device containing xyloglucan (XG), pea protein and tannins (PPT) from grape-seed extract, and xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) has proven restoration of intestinal barrier function. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with the medical device XG + PPT + XOS (XG-PPT-XOS) in adult patients with IBS-D in a clinical setting for 6 months. Material and methods: This was a multicentre, open-label, prospective, observational study conducted to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of XG-PPT-XOS. IBS-D adult patients (Rome IV criteria) were included and received two tablets twice daily for 6 months. IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) and bowel habit were registered at baseline and monthly, until the end of follow up. Efficacy was evaluated by comparison of mean scores at each time point. Results: 50 patients were included, of which 19 completed the 6 months. IBS-SSS score decreased from 312.2 ± 82.2 to 213.6 ± 109.9 (p < 0.0001) at 1 month and 192.0 ± 108.9 at the last visit completed; diarrhoea score decreased from 45.6 ± 17.9 to 25.7 ± 17.7 and 25.3 ± 17.2 at 1 month and at the last visit completed, respectively. Pain score decreased from 107.8 ± 49.9 at baseline to 73.2 ± 57.3 (p < 0.0001) at 1 month and bloating score from 56.4 ± 28.8 at baseline to 42.8 ± 32.6 (p < 0.001) at 1 month, reaching 62.4 ± 56.0 and 40.4 ± 34.3, respectively, at the last visit completed. Adverse effects were mild and mostly not related to treatment. Conclusion: Treating IBS-D patients with XG-PPT-XOS is effective and safe in the long term within a clinical setting, improving all IBS-D symptoms from the first month of treatment and showing a sustained response over the term of therapy. © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - Unspecific gastrointestinal symptoms associated with milk consumption are common. In addition to lactose, also other components of milk may be involved. We studied whether the partial hydrolysation of milk proteins would affect gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects with functional gastrointestinal disorders. In a randomised, placebo-controlled crossover intervention, subjects (n = 41) were given ordinary or hydrolysed high-protein, lactose-free milkshakes (500 mL, 50 g protein) to be consumed daily for ten days. After a washout period of ten days, the other product was consumed for another ten days. Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded daily during the study periods, and a validated irritable bowel syndrome-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) questionnaire was completed at the beginning of the study and at the end of both study periods. Blood and urine samples were analysed for markers of inflammation, intestinal permeability and immune activation. Both the IBS-SSS score (p = 0.001) and total symptom score reported daily (p = 0.002) were significantly reduced when participants consumed the hydrolysed product. Less bloating was reported during both study periods when compared with the baseline (p < 0.01 for both groups). Flatulence (p = 0.01) and heartburn (p = 0.03) decreased when consuming the hydrolysed product but not when drinking the control product. No significant differences in the levels of inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF-α and interleukin 6, IL-6), intestinal permeability (fatty acid binding protein 2, FABP2) or immune activation (1-methylhistamine) were detected between the treatment periods. The results suggest that the partial hydrolysation of milk proteins (mainly casein) reduces subjective symptoms to some extent in subjects with functional gastrointestinal disorders. The mechanism remains to be resolved. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background More effective treatments are needed for patients with postinfectious, diarrhoea-predominant, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Accordingly, we conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week-long trial to assess the efficacy and safety of oral glutamine therapy in patients who developed IBS-D with increased intestinal permeability following an enteric infection. Methods Eligible adults were randomised to glutamine (5 g/t.i.d.) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was a reduction of ≥50 points on the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS-SS). Secondary endpoints included: raw IBS-SS scores, changes in daily bowel movement frequency, stool form (Bristol Stool Scale) and intestinal permeability. Results Fifty-four glutamine and 52 placebo subjects completed the 8-week study. The primary endpoint occurred in 43 (79.6%) in the glutamine group and 3 (5.8%) in the placebo group (a 14-fold difference). Glutamine also reduced all secondary endpoint means: IBS-SS score at 8 weeks (301 vs 181, p<0.0001), daily bowel movement frequency (5.4 vs 2.9±1.0, p<0.0001), Bristol Stool Scale (6.5 vs 3.9, p<0.0001) and intestinal permeability (0.11 vs 0.05; p<0.0001). 'Intestinal hyperpermeability' (elevated urinary lactulose/mannitol ratios) was normalised in the glutamine but not the control group. Adverse events and rates of study-drug discontinuation were low and similar in the two groups. No serious adverse events were observed. Conclusions In patients with IBS-D with intestinal hyperpermeability following an enteric infection, oral dietary glutamine supplements dramatically and safely reduced all major IBS-related endpoints. Large randomised clinical trials (RCTs) should now be done to validate these findings, assess quality of life benefits and explore pharmacological mechanisms.

AB  - Zonulin protein is a haptoglobin precursor and functions to modulate the permeability of tight junctions between enterocytes. Local inflammation or systemic inflammation can trigger zonulin expression. While the increased zonulin level causes an increase of intestinal permeability and entrance of foreign antigens, the latter can increase insulin resistance and inflammation. Polycystic ovarian syndrome affects women during their reproductive age characterized by hyperinsulinemia and/or hyperandrogenemia and associated with infertility problems. Changes in gut permeability such as irritable bowel syndrome are often found in PCOS patients. While metformin increases insulin mediates glucose uptake and, acts as an insulin-sensitizing drug used to treat PCOS patients is recently discovered to reshape intestinal bacteria and hence may affect intestinal action. This study was designed to find any association between zonulin level and other parameters in PCOS patients and to find metformin treatment effects on zonulin in PCOS patients. Thirty-one newly diagnosed PCOS women agree to take metformin 850 mg twice daily for three months and, and to give fasting serum samples to measure zonulin, FSH, LH, total testosterone, free testosterone, SHBG, fasting insulin, and fasting serum glucose before and after treatment. The free testosterone and zonulin are determined by the ELISA technique while the other parameters are determined by the Cobas technique. According to patients’ Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA-IR), the Patients were divided into two sub-groups: the first group consisting of those with initial HOMA-IR less than two and the second group was those of an initial HOMA-IR of between two to four. Whereas the first group showed no significant response to treatment, the second group showed a better response to metformin treatment, as demonstrated by their LH, total testosterone, free testosterone, fasting insulin, zonulin, and glucose levels. These parameters markedly improved after metformin treatment with p-values of 0.08, 0.09, 0.07. 0.04, 0.01 and 0.06, respectively. © 2020 All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) ES1 is a probiotic strain capable of modulating microbiome composition, anti-inflammatory activity and intestinal barrier function. We investigated the use of B. Longum ES1 in the treatment of patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Sixteen patients were treated for 8 or 12 weeks with B. Longum ES1 (1 × 109 CFU/day). Serum zonulin and cytokines were measured at baseline (T0) and at the end of therapy (T1). Clinical response to therapy was assessed by IBS Severity Scoring System. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-12p70 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α levels decreased from T0 to T1, irrespective of treatment duration (p < 0.05), while zonulin levels diminished only in patients treated for 12 weeks (p = 0.036). Clinical response was observed in 5/16 patients (31%): 4/8 (50%) treated for 12 weeks and 1/8 (13%) treated for 8 weeks. Abdominal pain improved only in patients treated for 12 weeks (5/8 vs. 0/8, p = 0.025), while stool consistency improved regardless of therapy duration (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the results of this pilot study showed, in IBS-D patients treated for 12 weeks with B. longum ES1, a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and intestinal permeability as well as an improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms, but further studies including a placebo-control group are necessary to prove a causal link. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Leaky gut that is a condition reflecting intestinal barrier dysfunction has been attracting attention for its relations with many diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome or Alzheimer dementia. We have recently demonstrated that ghrelin acts in the brain to improve leaky gut via the vagus nerve. In the present study, we tried to clarify the precise central mechanisms by which ghrelin improves intestinal barrier function through the vagus nerve. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in rats. Adenosine receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), blocked the intracisternal ghrelin-induced improvement of intestinal hyperpermeability while dopamine, cannabinoid or opioid receptor antagonist failed to prevent it. Since DPCPX can block adenosine A1 and adenosine A2B receptors, we examined which subtype is involved in the mechanism. Intracisternal injection of adenosine A2B agonist but not adenosine A1 agonist improved colonic hyperpermeability, while peripheral injection of adenosine A2B agonist failed to improve it. Intracisternal adenosine A2B agonist-induced improvement of colonic hyperpermeability was blocked by vagotomy. Adenosine A2B specific antagonist, alloxazine blocked the ghrelin- or central vagal stimulation by 2-deoxy-D-glucose-induced improvement of intestinal hyperpermeability. These results suggest that activation of adenosine A2B receptors in the central nervous system is capable of improving intestinal barrier function through the vagal pathway, and the adenosine A2B receptors may mediate the ghrelin-induced improvement of leaky gut in a vagal dependent fashion. These findings may help us understand the pathophysiology in not only gastrointestinal diseases but also non-gastrointestinal diseases associated with the altered intestinal permeability. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Animal studies have shown that intestinal barrier function is compromised with aging. We aimed to assess the effects of aging on intestinal barrier function in humans in vivo and ex vivo. In this cross-sectional study, healthy subjects and subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) of older (65–75 years) and young adult age (18–40 years) were compared. In vivo gastrointestinal site-specific permeability was assessed by a multi-sugar test, taking into account potential confounders. Sigmoid biopsies were collected from subgroups of healthy young adults and elderly for ex vivo Ussing chamber experiments, gene transcription of barrier-related genes and staining of junctional proteins. No significant differences between healthy young adults and elderly were found for small intestinal, colonic and whole gut permeability (P ≥ 0.142). In IBS patients, gastroduodenal and colonic permeability did not differ significantly (P ≥ 0.400), but small intestinal and whole gut permeability were higher in elderly versus young adults (P ≤ 0.009), mainly driven by the IBS-diarrhea subtype. Ussing chamber experiments with or without stressor (P ≥ 0.052), and relative expression of intestinal barrier-related genes (P ≥ 0.264) showed no significant differences between healthy elderly and young adults, as confirmed by immunofluorescent stainings. Overall, the functional capacity of the intestinal barrier is maintained in elderly. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function is a hallmark of a variety of pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBD patients with IBS-like symptoms show higher interleukin-13 (IL-13) serum levels and poor psychological well-being. Supplementary glutamine reduced the daily bowel movement frequency, improved the stool form, and normalized intestinal hyperpermeability. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of IL-13 and supplementary glutamine on human intestinal epithelial function in vitro. Methods: Caco-2 cells were grown on TranswellTM inserts. -IL-13 was added to the basolateral compartment, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability measured. Effects of glutamine or the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were assessed. Involvement of tight junction proteins was assessed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Results: IL-13 significantly decreased TEER and increased FITC labeled-dextran epithelial permeability. IL-13 stimulation decreased the claudin-1 expression and increased the claudin-2 expression. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced decrease of TEER and increase of FITC labeled-dextran permeability. Further, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor showed this alleviating effect while the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 inhibitor did not. Conclusions: IL-13 induced barrier integrity impairment by decreasing claudin-1 and increasing claudin-2. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced barrier dysfunction by increasing claudin-1 expression, via disruption of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway.  © 2021 S. Karger AG.

AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is a bacterial human pathogen causing gastroenteritis and sequelae like irritable bowel syndrome. Epidemiologists count the human campylobacteriosis by C. jejuni as the most common foodborne zoonosis and bacterial diarrheal disease worldwide. Based on bioinformatics predictions for potential protective compounds in campylobacteriosis, the question was raised whether the plant-based polyphenol resveratrol is sufficient to attenuate intestinal epithelial damage induced by C. jejuni. We investigated this by performing experimental infection studies in an epithelial cell culture and the secondary abiotic IL-10−/− mouse model. In C. jejuni-infected human colonic HT-29/B6 cell monolayers, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was decreased and the paracellular marker flux of fluorescein (332 Da) increased. Concomitantly, the tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin and claudin-5 were re-distributed off the tight junction domain. This was accompanied by an increased induction of epithelial apoptosis, both changes contributing to compromised barrier function and the opening of the leak pathway induced by C. jejuni. In parallel, the recovery experiments with the application of resveratrol revealed a functional improvement of the disturbed epithelial barrier in both models in vitro and in vivo. During treatment with resveratrol, TJ localization of occludin and claudin-5 was fully restored in the paracellular domain of HT-29/B6 cells. Moreover, resveratrol decreased the rate of epithelial apoptosis. These resveratrol-induced molecular and cellular effects would therefore be expected to improve epithelial barrier function, thereby minimizing the so-called leaky gut phenomenon. In conclusion, the induction of the leak pathway by C. jejuni and the restoration of barrier function by resveratrol demonstrates its effectiveness as a potential preventive or therapeutic method of mitigating the leaky gut associated with campylobacteriosis. © Copyright © 2021 Lobo de Sá, Heimesaat, Bereswill, Nattramilarasu, Schulzke and Bücker.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to investigate the role of Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) H19 in the pathogenesis of Diarrhea Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D), and further to the regulatory effect of LncRNA H19 on AQP1, 3 in the intestinal mucosa of IBS-D patients, so as to seek a new way to elucidate the mechanism of IBS in clinic. Methods: The levels of LncRNA H19, AQP1, and AQP3 were detected in colonic tissues of IBS-D patients, compared with that in healthy controls. Through RNA gene interference and activation methods, small activating RNA (saRNA) and small interfering (siRNA) were transfered into Caco-2 cells in vitro experiment, and sub-group for two control group, siH19 empty vector group, siH19 interference group, overexpression H19 vector group, and overexpression H19 empty vector group. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were applied to evaluate the expression levels of LncRNA H19 and the amount of AQP1 and AQP3 protein expression, respectively. Results: Compared with healthy volunteers, the levels of LncRNA H19, AQP1, and AQP3 in the colonic mucosa of IBS-D patients were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The results in vitro transfection experiment revealed that the level of LncRNA H19 in the siH19 interference group was significantly declined (P < 0.05), while there was a remarkable increase in the overexpression H19 vector group (P < 0.05), compared with the corresponding control groups. The expression of AQP1 and AQP3 in Caco-2 cells was of positive correlation with the level of LncRNA H19. Conclusion: That the down-regulation of LncRNA H19 resulted in the expression changes of AQP1 and AQP3 may play an important role in the occurrence and development of IBS-D. © Copyright © 2021 Chao, Wang, Yang and Zhang.

AB  - Background: Oral monosaccharides and disaccharides are used to measure in vivo human gut permeability through urinary excretion. Aims: The aims were as follows: (1) to obtain normative data on small intestinal and colonic permeability; (2) to assess variance on standard 16 g fiber diet performed twice; (3) to determine whether dietary fiber influences gut permeability measurements; and (4) to present pilot data using 2 selected probes in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Methods: Sixty healthy female and male adults, age 18–70 years, participated in 3 randomized studies (2 studies on 16.25 g and 1 study on 32.5 g fiber) in otherwise standardized diets. At each test, the following sugars were ingested: 12C-mannitol, 13C-mannitol, rhamnose (monosaccharides), sucralose, and lactulose (disaccharides). Standardized meals were administered from 24 hours before and during 24 hours post-sugars with 3 urine collections: 0–2, 2–8, and 8–24 hours. Sugars were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Eighteen patients with IBS-D underwent 24-hour excretion studies after oral 13C-mannitol and lactulose. Results: Baseline sugars (>3-fold above lower limits of quantitation) were identified in the 3 studies: 12C-mannitol in all participants; sucralose in 4–8, and rhamnose in 1–3. Median excretions/24 h (percentage of administered dose) for 13C-mannitol, rhamnose, lactulose, and sucralose were ∼30%, ∼15%, 0.32%, and 2.3%, respectively. 13C-mannitol and rhamnose reflected mainly small intestinal permeability. Intraindividual saccharide excretions were consistent, with minor differences with 16.25 g vs 32.5 g fiber diets. Median interindividual coefficient of variation was 76.5% (10–90 percentile: 34.6–111.0). There were no significant effects of sex, age, or body mass index on permeability measurements in health. 13C-mannitol measurements are feasible in IBS-D. Conclusions: Baseline 12C-mannitol excretion precludes its use; 13C-mannitol is the preferred probe for small intestinal permeability. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Rationale: Intestinal permeability plays an important role in gut-brain axis communication. Recent studies indicate that intestinal permeability increases in neonate pups during maternal separation (MS). Objectives: The present study aims to determine whether pharmacological inhibition of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which regulates tight junction contraction and controls intestinal permeability, in stressed neonates, protects against the long-term effects of MS. Methods: Male Wistar rats were exposed to MS (3 h per day from post-natal day (PND)2 to PND14) or left undisturbed and received daily intraperitoneal injection of a MLCK inhibitor (ML-7, 5 mg/kg) or vehicle during the same period. At adulthood, emotional behaviors, corticosterone response to stress, and gut microbiota composition were analyzed. Results: ML-7 restored gut barrier function in MS rats specifically during the neonatal period. Remarkably, ML-7 prevented MS-induced sexual reward–seeking impairment and reversed the alteration of corticosterone response to stress at adulthood. The effects of ML-7 were accompanied by the normalization of the abundance of members of Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiales, Desulfovibrio, Bacteroidales, Enterorhabdus, and Bifidobacterium in the feces of MS rats at adulthood. Conclusions: Altogether, our work suggests that improvement of intestinal barrier defects during development may alleviate some of the long-term effects of early-life stress and provides new insight on brain–gut axis communication in a context of stress. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier are crucial pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and injection of lipopolysaccharide or corticotropin-releasing factor, and repeated water avoidance stress simulate these gastrointestinal changes in rat (IBS models). We previously demonstrated that losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist prevented these changes, and we attempted to determine the effects of EMA401, an AT2 receptor antagonist in the current study. EMA401 blocked visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in these models, and naloxone reversed the effects by EMA401. These results suggest that EMA401 may improve gut function via opioid signaling in IBS. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Background. Maren pills have been used to treat constipation. Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) plays a vital role in regulating water transfer in the colon. It has been reported that the downregulation of AQP3 can regulate liquid water metabolism and intestinal permeability in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rats' colon via NF-κB pathway. In this study, we investigated whether the laxative effect of Maren pills is associated with the regulation of AQP3 and NF-κB signaling pathway in the colon. Methods. The compound diphenoxylate suspension-induced STC rats received Maren pills intragastrically for 1 consecutive week to evaluate the laxative effect of Maren pills involving the regulation of AQP3 and NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) were treated with drug serum to obtain in vitro data. Results. Our results revealed that treatment with Maren pills increased the stool number, moisture content of feces, and intestinal transit rate in a dose-dependent manner. Maren pills significantly increased the AQP3, fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and protein kinase A (PKA) proteins in the colon of rats and in HT-29 cells. Mechanistically, Maren pills obviously inhibited the activation of NF-κB pathway in the colon of rats and in HT-29 cells. Conclusion. These results suggest that the laxative effect of Maren pills is associated with the increased expression of AQP3 by downregulating NF-κB signal pathway. © 2020 Yu Zhan et al.

AB  - A role for immunoproteasome in the regulation of intestinal permeability has been previously suggested both in mice during water avoidance stress (WAS) and in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Here, we provide evidence that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) contributes to the pathophysiology of IBS. Indeed, we report that colonic proteome is altered in WAS mice and that β2i subunit deficiency modifies the proteome response that is associated with a limitation of colonic hyperpermeability. Interestingly, we show specific alterations of proteins involved in UPS, mitochondrial, and energy metabolism. We also report changes in the pattern of colonic ubiquitome in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients and particularly a reduced expression of ubiquitinated proteins involved in the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) inflammatory signaling pathway. All these data suggest that immunoproteasome targeting may represent a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBS patients with increased intestinal permeability. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Momordica charantia exerts anti-inflammatory effect against ulcerative colitis. Momordica charantia polysaccharides (MCPs) attenuate gastritis through inhibition of ethanol-induced inflammatory response. Objective: The role of MCPs in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is investigated. Materials and Methods: Chemical stimulation followed by acute and chronic pressure stimulation was used to establish rats model with IBS-D. The model rats were then administrated with MCPs. Defecation frequency, fecal water content and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score were then recorded. Pathologic changes in the colonic tissues were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Inflammation was detected by ELISA and qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry was used to assess intestinal mucosal permeability. Results: First, IBS-D of mice wasIBS-D ratsmice exhibited many abnormal clinical manifestations, including increased frequency of defecation, fecal water content, and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score. Second, the mice were administrated with MCPs, which reduced frequency of defecation, fecal water content, and AWR score, and 100-mg/kg MCPs indicated therapeutic effect on IBS-D mice equivalent to rifaximin. Moreover, MCPs also ameliorated pathologic changes in the colonic tissues of IBS-D mice. Third, inflammatory response in IBS-D mice was also suppressed by MCPs through up-regulation of Interleukin (IL)-10, and downregulation of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), Interleukin(IL)-1B, and IL-6. MCPs enhanced levels of occludin (OCLN) and zona occludens protein-1 (ZO-1) in IBS-D mice to improve intestinal mucosal permeability. Finally, phosphorylation of p65 in IBS-D mice was reduced by MCP treatment. Conclusion: MCPs ameliorated intestinal permeability and repressed intestinal inflammation to attenuate IBS-D by inactivating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling © 2022. Codon Publications.

AB  - Background & Aims: Increased gut permeability might contribute to the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome or functional abdominal pain (IBS or FAP). We investigated whether siblings and parents of children with IBS or FAP have increased gut permeability. Methods: We performed permeability tests (using sucrose, lactulose, mannitol, and sucralose) on 29 siblings and 43 parents of children with IBS or FAP, and 43 children (controls) and 42 parents of controls, from primary and secondary care. Permeability studies were repeated in 7 siblings and 37 parents of children with IBS or FAP and 23 controls and 36 parents of controls following ingestion of 400 mg of ibuprofen. Percent recovery of sucrose was calculated based on analyses of urine collected overnight; the lactulose/mannitol ratio and percent recovery of sucralose were based on analyses of urine samples collected over a 24-hour period. Results: When we controlled for age, sex, and family membership, siblings of children with IBS or FAP had increased small bowel permeability (urinary lactulose/mannitol ratio) vs controls (P =.004). There was no difference in gastroduodenal (percent sucrose recovery) or colonic (percent sucralose recovery) permeability between groups. Similarly, parents of children with IBS or FAP also had increased small bowel permeability, compared with parents of controls (P =.015), with no differences in gastric or colonic permeability. After administration of ibuprofen, gastroduodenal and small bowel permeability tended to be greater in IBS or FAP siblings (P =.08) and gastroduodenal permeability tended to be greater in IBS or FAP parents (P =.086). Conclusions: Siblings and parents of children with IBS or FAP have increased baseline small intestinal permeability compared with control children and their parents. These results indicate that there are familial influences on gastrointestinal permeability in patients with IBS or FAP. © 2020 AGA Institute

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and it is associated with different neurological disorders. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the gut-brain-axis has a central function in the perpetuation of IBS, and for this reason, it can be considered a possible therapeutic target. N-Palmitoylethanolamine-oxazoline (PEA-OXA) possesses anti-inflammatory and potent neuroprotective effects. Although recent studies have explained the neuroprotective properties of PEA-OXA, nothing is known about its effects on the gut-brain axis during colitis. The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism and the effect of PEA-OXA on the gut-brain axis in rats subjected to experimental colitis induced by oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Daily oral administration of PEA-OXA (10 mg/kg daily o.s.) was able to decrease the body weight loss, macroscopic damage, colon length, histological alteration, and inflammation after DSS induction. Additionally, PEA-OXA administration enhanced neurotrophic growth factor release and decreased the astroglial and microglial activation induced by DSS. Moreover, PEA-OXA restored intestinal permeability and tight junctions (TJs) as well as reduced apoptosis in the colon and brain. In our work, we demonstrated, for the first time, the action of PEA-OXA on the gut-brain axis in a model of DSS-induced colitis and its implication on the “secondary” effects associated with colonic disturbance. © 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology

AB  - Objective: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gut-brain disorder associated with increased gut permeability. Zonulin has been suggested to regulate the gut barrier and claimed to be pre-haptoglobin 2 (pre-HP2) and circulating zonulin is often used as a proxy for gastrointestinal permeability. This study investigated the correlation between colonic paracellular permeability and levels of circulating zonulin and pre-HP2. Materials and Methods: Colonic biopsies from 32 patients with IBS and 15 healthy controls (HC) were used to measure permeability in Ussing chambers and levels of zonulin (Cusabio ELISA). Zonulin was also measured in blood samples from 40 HC, 78 patients with IBS and 20 patients with celiac disease (CeD), before and after a gluten-free diet. In addition, we verified HP genotype and circulating pre-HP2 using a monoclonal pre-HP2 antibody (Bio-Rad) by ELISA. Results: Increased colonic paracellular permeability correlated positively with zonulin levels in IBS biopsies, but negatively with plasma zonulin. We found no agreement between circulating zonulin and pre-HP2. Genotyping revealed non-specificity of the zonulin kit, as all pre-HP2 non-producers presented detectable levels. Patients with CeD displayed higher pre-HP2 and zonulin levels compared to HC. A gluten-free diet in patients with CeD led to lower serum zonulin and pre-HP2 concentrations. Conclusions: Our study suggests that neither circulating zonulin nor pre-HP2 mirror colonic permeability. Our data corroborate previous reports showing the inability of the Cusabio zonulin kit to target zonulin and highlights that the results of studies using this kit must be re-examined with caution. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: A “leaky” gut barrier has been implicated in the initiation and progression of a multitude of diseases, for example, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome and celiac disease. Here we show how pro-hormone Chromogranin A (CgA), produced by the enteroendocrine cells, and Catestatin (CST: hCgA352-372), the most abundant CgA-derived proteolytic peptide, affect the gut barrier. Methods: Colon tissues from region-specific CST-knockout (CST-KO) mice, CgA-knockout (CgA-KO) and WT mice were analysed by immunohistochemistry, western blot, ultrastructural and flowcytometry studies. FITC-dextran assays were used to measure intestinal barrier function. Mice were supplemented with CST or CgA fragment pancreastatin (PST: CgA250-301). The microbial composition of cecum was determined. CgA and CST levels were measured in blood of IBD patients. Results: Plasma levels of CST were elevated in IBD patients. CST-KO mice displayed (a) elongated tight, adherens junctions and desmosomes similar to IBD patients, (b) elevated expression of Claudin 2, and (c) gut inflammation. Plasma FITC-dextran measurements showed increased intestinal paracellular permeability in the CST-KO mice. This correlated with a higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, a dysbiotic pattern commonly encountered in various diseases. Supplementation of CST-KO mice with recombinant CST restored paracellular permeability and reversed inflammation, whereas CgA-KO mice supplementation with CST and/or PST in CgA-KO mice showed that intestinal paracellular permeability is regulated by the antagonistic roles of these two peptides: CST reduces and PST increases permeability. Conclusion: The pro-hormone CgA regulates the intestinal paracellular permeability. CST is both necessary and sufficient to reduce permeability and primarily acts by antagonizing PST. © 2021 Scandinavian Physiological Society. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Disruption of intestinal barrier homeostasis is an important pathogenic factor in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) improves IBS symptoms through unclear mechanisms. Previous studies utilizing colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines showed that LGG metabolites prevented interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) induced barrier damage but the model employed limited these findings. We aimed to interrogate the protective effects of LGG on epithelial barrier function using human intestinal epithelial cultures (enteroids and colonoids) as a more physiologic model. To investigate how LGG affects epithelial barrier function, we measured FITC-Dextran (FD4) flux across the epithelium as well as tight junction zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and occludin (OCLN) expression. Colonoids were incubated with fecal supernatants from IBS patients (IBS-FSN) and healthy controls in the presence or absence of LGG to examine changes in gut permeability. Enteroids incubated with IFN-gamma demonstrated a downregulation of OCLN and ZO-1 expression by 67% and 50%, respectively (p<0.05). This was accompanied by increased paracellular permeability as shown by leakage of FD4. Pretreatment of enteroids with LGG prevented these changes and normalized OCLN and ZO-1 to control levels. These actions were independent of its action against apoptosis. However, these protective effects were not seen with LGG cell wall extracts, LGG DNA, or denatured (boiled) LGG. Intriguingly, IBS-FSN injected into colonoids increased paracellular permeability, which was prevented by LGG. LGG, likely due to secreted proteins, protects against epithelial barrier dysfunction. Bacterial-derived factors to modulate gut barrier function may be a treatment option in disorders such as IBS. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Individuals with intestinal barrier dysfunction are more prone to autoimmunity. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gut bacteria have been shown to play a role in systemic inflammation, leading to the opening of the gut and blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study aims to measure antibodies against LPS and barrier proteins in samples positive for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and compare them with these same antibodies in controls to determine whether a correlation between LPS and barrier proteins could be found. We obtained 94 ASCA- and 94 ANCA-positive blood samples, as well as 188 blood samples from healthy controls. Samples were assessed for antibodies to LPS, zonulin+occludin, S100B, and aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Results show significant elevation in antibodies in about 30% of ASCA- and ANCA-positive sera and demonstrate positive linear relationships between these antibodies. The findings suggest that individuals positive for ASCA and ANCA have increased odds of developing intestinal and BBB permeability compared to healthy subjects. The levels of LPS antibodies in both ASCA- and ANCA-positive and negative specimens showed from low and moderate to high correlation with antibodies to barrier proteins. This study shows that LPS, by damaging the gut and BBBs, contribute to the extra-intestinal manifestation of IBD. We conclude that IBD patients should be screened for LPS antibodies in an effort to detect or prevent possible barrier damage at the earliest stage possible to abrogate disease symptoms in IBS and associated disorders. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients often experience meal-associated symptoms. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Aim: To determine small intestinal mechanisms of lipid-induced symptoms and rectal hypersensitivity in IBS. Methods: We recruited 26 IBS patients (12 IBS-C, 14 IBS-D) and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). In vivo permeability was assessed using saccharide excretion assay. Rectal sensitivity was assessed using a barostat before and after small bowel lipid infusion; symptoms were assessed throughout. Next, an extended upper endoscopy with probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) was performed with changes induced by lipids. Duodenal and jejunal mucosal biopsies were obtained for transcriptomics. Results: Following lipid infusion, a higher proportion of HV than IBS patients reported no pain, no nausea, no fullness and no urgency (P < 0.05 for all). In a model adjusted for sex and anxiety, IBS-C and IBS-D patients had lower thresholds for first rectal sensation (P = 0.0007) and pain (P = 0.004) than HV. In vivo small intestinal permeability and mean pCLE scores were similar between IBS patients and HV. Post-lipid, pCLE scores were higher than pre-lipid but were not different between groups. Baseline duodenal transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) 1 and 3 expression was increased in IBS-D, and TRPV3 in IBS-C. Duodenal TRPV1 expression correlated with abdominal pain (r = 0.51, FDR = 0.01), and inversely with first rectal sensation (r = −0.48, FDR = 0.01) and pain (r = −0.41, FDR = 0.02) thresholds. Conclusion: Lipid infusion elicits a greater symptom response in IBS patients than HV, which is associated with small intestinal expression of TRPV channels. TRPV-mediated small intestinal chemosensitivity may mediate post-meal symptoms in IBS. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Markers for gut integrity and inflammation have received increasing interest as intestinal permeability and innate immune system activation are suggested as possible pathophysiological mechanisms in non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). We aimed to assess relevant biomarkers in NCGS by analyzing serum levels of gut integrity and permeability markers, pro-inflammatory cytokines and antigliadin IgG in patients with suspected NCGS on a gluten-free diet (GFD), and compare them to serum levels in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and healthy controls (HC). Patients and Methods: Serum samples collected from patients with suspected NCGS on a GFD (n=20, 14 women, 21–62 years), IBS (n=20, 16 women, 24–67 years) and HC (n=20, 14 women, 21–54 years) were analyzed. IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) was applied to evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: The IBS-SSS score was higher in subjects with suspected NCGS and IBS patients compared to HC (p<0.0001). No significant differences were found in the serum levels of any of the gut integrity and permeability markers, cytokines or antigliadin IgG antibodies between the three groups. However, positive correlations were observed between claudin-1 and i-FABP, and between claudin-1 and antigliadin IgG antibodies. Conclusion: No differences in serum levels of gut integrity and permeability markers, proinflammatory cytokines or antigliadin IgG antibodies were found among patients with suspected NCGS on a GFD, IBS and HC. © 2021 Dale et al.

AB  - In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) undergoing biologic therapy, biomarkers of treatment response are still scarce. This study aimed to evaluate whether serum zonulin, a biomarker of intestinal permeability; soluble CD163 (sCD163), a macrophage activation marker; and a panel of serum cytokines could predict the response to biologic treatment in patients with IBD. For this purpose, we prospectively enrolled 101 patients with IBD and 19 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as a control group; 60 out of 101 patients underwent treatment with biologics. Zonulin, sCD163, and cytokines were measured at the baseline in all patients and after 10 weeks of treatment in the 60 patients who underwent biologic therapy. We observed that zonulin levels were higher in IBD patients with active disease compared to those in remission (p = 0.035), and that sCD163 values were higher in patients with IBD compared to those with IBS (p = 0.042), but no association with therapy response was observed for either biomarker. Conversely, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha showed a significant reduction from baseline to week 10 of treatment, particularly in responder patients. By multivariate logistic regression analysis corrected for disease (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis), type of biologic drug (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Vedolizumab, or Ustekinumab) and disease activity, the reduction in IL-6 values was associated with a clinical response at 12 months of biological therapy (odds ratio (OR) = 4.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25–18.02, p = 0.022). In conclusion, the measurement of serum IL-6 in biologics-treated IBD patients may allow for the prediction of response to treatment at 12 months of therapy and thus may help with tailoring personalized treatment strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - About 14% of veterans who suffer from Gulf war illness (GWI) complain of some form of gastrointestinal disorder but with no significant markers of clinical pathology. Our previous studies have shown that exposure to GW chemicals resulted in altered microbiome which was associated with damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release followed by neuro and gastrointestinal inflammation with loss of gut barrier integrity. Enteric glial cells (EGC) are emerging as important regulators of the gastrointestinal tract and have been observed to change to a reactive phenotype in several functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS and IBD. This study is aimed at investigating the role of dysbiosis associated EGC immune-activation and redox instability in contributing to observed gastrointestinal barrier integrity loss in GWI via altered tight junction protein expression. Using a mouse model of GWI and in vitro studies with cultured EGC and use of antibiotics to ensure gut decontamination we show that exposure to GW chemicals caused dysbiosis associated change in EGCs. EGCs changed to a reactive phenotype characterized by activation of TLR4-S100β/RAGE-iNOS pathway causing release of nitric oxide and activation of NOX2 since gut sterility with antibiotics prevented this change. The resulting peroxynitrite generation led to increased oxidative stress that triggered inflammation as shown by increased NLRP-3 inflammasome activation and increased cell death. Activated EGCs in vivo and in vitro were associated with decrease in tight junction protein occludin and selective water channel aquaporin-3 with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2. The tight junction protein levels were restored following a parallel treatment of GWI mice with a TLR4 inhibitor SsnB and butyric acid that are known to decrease the immunoactivation of EGCs. Our study demonstrates that immune-redox mechanisms in EGC are important players in the pathology in GWI and may be possible therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in GWI symptom persistence. © 2019 Kimono, Sarkar, Albadrani, Seth, Bose, Mondal, Li, Kar, Nagarkatti, Nagarkatti, Sullivan, Janulewicz, Lasley, Horner, Klimas and Chatterjee.

AB  - Aims: Defective tight junctions (TJs) can induce intestinal epithelial dysfunction, which participates in various diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. However, the mechanisms of TJ defects remain unclear. Our study revealed the role of Piezo1 in regulating intestinal epithelial function and TJs. Materials and methods: The human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 were cultured on Transwell plate to form an epithelial barrier in vitro, and Piezo1 expression was manipulated using a lentivirus vector. Epithelial function was evaluated by measuring transepithelial electronic resistance (TEER) and 4-kDa FITC-dextran (FD4) transmission. TJ proteins (claudin-1, occludin, ZO-1) were evaluated by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunostaining analysis. Potential signal pathways, including the ROCK and Erk pathways, were detected. Moreover, to explore the regulatory effect of Piezo1 activity on epithelial function, inhibitors (ruthenium red, GsMTx4) and an agonist (Yoda1) were introduced both ex vivo and in vitro. Key findings: Alteration of Piezo1 expression altered epithelial function and the expression of the tight junction protein claudin-1. Piezo1 expression regulated phosphorylated ROCK1/2 expression, whereas interference on ROCK1/2 prevented the regulation of claudin-1 by Piezo1. In both Caco-2 monolayer and mouse colon epithelium, Piezo1 activity directly modulated epithelial function and permeability. Significance: Piezo1 negatively regulates epithelial barrier function by affecting the expression of claudin-1. Such regulation may be achieved partially via the ROCK1/2 pathway. Moreover, activating Piezo1 can induce epithelial dysfunction. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: The precise pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains unresolved; however, recent studies have reported that patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS exhibit an increased small intestinal permeability and increased number of enterochromaffin cells containing high 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT; serotonin) levels. In this study, we investigated whether 5HT has the potential to modulate small intestinal epithelial cell permeability, focusing on tight junction-associated proteins. Methods: The differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayer on porous filters (Millicell) was used. Then, 5HT was added to the lower Millicell compartment for 7 days. Intestinal epithelial cell permeability was assessed by measuring the flux of paracellular permeability markers. We further assessed the expression of occludin in the 5HT-stimulated Caco-2 monolayer. Results: We found that 5HT did not affect the viability of Caco-2 cells at concentrations up to 100 µM during the experimental period. Administration of 5HT to the basal side of Caco-2 cells increased the flux of 3H-labeled mannitol (182 Da) but did not increase that of FITC-dextran (4000 Da). Among the tight junction proteins, the expression of occludin was specifically decreased by stimulation with 5HT at a concentration of 100 µM. Conclusion: In conclusion, excessive 5HT in the basal side increased the permeability of intestinal epithelial cells via reduction of occludin expression. © Copyright 2022 by The Turkish Society of Gastroenterology

AB  - Durable spore-forming probiotics are increasingly formulated into foods, beverages, and dietary supplements. To help meet this demand, the safety and efficacy of daily supplementation of Bacillus subtilis BS50 for 6 weeks was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical trial of 76 healthy adults. Before and during supplementation, gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded daily using a multi-symptom questionnaire. Clinical chemistry, hematology, plasma lipids, and intestinal permeability and inflammation markers were measured at baseline and end of study. Compared to placebo, 2 × 109 colony-forming units (CFU) BS50 per day increased the proportion of participants showing improvement from baseline to week 6 in the composite score for bloating, burping, and flatulence (47.4% vs. 22.2%), whereby the odds of detecting an improvement were higher with BS50 (OR [95% CI]: 3.2 [1.1, 8.7], p = .024). Analyses of individual gastrointestinal symptoms indicate that BS50 increased the proportion of participants showing an improvement at week 6 compared to placebo for burping (44.7% vs. 22.2%, p = .041) and bloating (31.6% vs. 13.9%, p = .071), without affecting other symptoms. There were no clinically meaningful changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, plasma lipids and intestinal permeability and other inflammation markers. In conclusion, the results suggest that dietary supplementation of 2 × 109 CFU Bacillus subtilis BS50 per day is a well-tolerated and safe strategy to alleviate gas-related gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy adults.

AB  - To investigate the beneficial effects of oridonin, a diterpenoid compound isolated from Rabdosia rubescens, on the inflammatory response in TNBS-induced post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) model and the underlying mechanism. Using the PI-IBS rat model and Caco-2 cell lines, we found that intestinal barrier function reflected by lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio and tight junction protein level was significantly ameliorated by oridonin. We also demonstrated that oridonin abrogated inflammation through inhibiting the phosphorylation of NF-κBp65 as well as its downstream gene (iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, and IL-6) level. Molecular docking studies confirmed the good binding activity between oridonin and PXR. In Caco-2 cell lines, oridonin markedly inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation in a PXR-dependent manner. Meanwhile, PXR and its target genes CYP3A4 and P-gp were induced by oridonin, which was associated with the decreased expression of NF-κB and the recovery of intestinal barrier. This study indicated that the therapeutic effect of oridonin on experimental PI-IBS through repairing intestinal barrier function may be closely associated with the regulatory role of PXR/NF-κB signaling pathway. Oridonin may serve as a PXR ligand for the development of drugs in the therapy for PI-IBS. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) problems affect half of Western populations. Symptoms can vary from frequent reflux to irritable bowel syndrome. The Nutrition Care (NC) Gut Relief Formula contains a combination of herbs and nutrients including curcumin, Aloe vera, slippery elm, guar gum, pectin, peppermint oil, and glutamine shown to benefit the GI system. The 16-week pre-post study tested the hypothesis that the NC Gut Relief Formula would be tolerable and effective in improving GI symptoms and gut health in adults with digestive disorders. A total of 43 participants completed the study. After a control phase, participants took 5 g/d and then 10 g/d of the formula for 4 weeks. GI symptoms and GI health were assessed by a series of validated questionnaires, for example, Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire, Bristol Stool Chart, Birmingham IBS Symptom Questionnaire, and by intestinal permeability and gut microbiota profile. The NC Gut Relief Formula significantly improved the frequency and severity of upper and lower GI symptoms by 60%-80%, including indigestion, heartburn, nausea, constipation or diarrhea, abdominal pain, and troublesome flatulence, and significantly improved physical functioning, energy levels, mood, and sleep by 60%-80%. All participants with normal stool, 90% with hard stool, and 66% with soft stool recovered from intestinal permeability, evident by normal lactulose to mannitol ratios. The NC Gut Relief Formula generally improved microbial profile, with a marked increase in Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Almost half of the participants with upper GI symptoms taking proton pump inhibitors for heartburn no longer required proton pump inhibitors at the end of the study. A third of participants were able to reintroduce food triggers, such as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols garlic, onion, and beans, or reflux-causing acidic/spicy foods, for example, citrus, tomato, and caffeine, in their diet after 3 months without symptom aggravation. The NC Gut Relief Formula significantly improved GI symptoms and associated quality of life over 3 months while reducing intestinal permeability, improving the microbial profile, reducing the need for reflux medication, and enabling the consumption of previous food triggers. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Background: Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang (TXYF) has been shown to be effective in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) patients. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and related mechanisms of TXYF in an IBS-D rat model. Methods: The IBS-D rat model was established with 4% acetic acid and evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Then, IBS-D rats were divided into control, TXYF and rifaximin groups and treated intragastrically with normal saline, TXYF and rifaximin, respectively, for 14 days. The following indicators were measured before and after treatment: defecation frequency, faecal water content (FWC) and colorectal distension (CRD). Histopathological changes in the distal colon were observed after treatment. The expression of OCLN and ZO1 in the distal colon of IBS-D rats reflected the intestinal mucosal permeability, as measured by qRT-PCR, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The NF-κB and Notch signalling pathways and inflammation-related factors were investigated. Results: After treatment with TXYF, the defecation frequency, FWC and CRD were significantly lower than those in the model group (P < 0.05). HE staining showed that colonic epithelial cells (CECs) in the IBS-D rats displayed significant oedema, impaired intestinal mucosal integrity and an increased influx of inflammatory cells. A significant reduction in granulocyte and CEC oedema was observed after the administration of TXYF and rifaximin compared to that of the model group and blank group (P < 0.05). TXYF significantly upregulated the expression of OCLN and ZO-1 and downregulated inflammation-related factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α and the chemokine KC) in IBS-D rats compared to those in the model group rats (P < 0.05). In terms of the NF-κB and Notch signalling pathways, the expression of NICD, p-ERK, Hes-1 and p-P65 decreased significantly in the TXYF and rifaximin groups, while the expression of ATOH1 increased significantly compared to that in the model group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: TXYF can effectively improve intestinal permeability and enhance intestinal mucosal barrier function, which may be related to inhibition of the inflammatory cascade and the NF-κB and Notch signalling pathways. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterised by intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing foods, in the absence of coeliac disease (CD) and wheat allergy. No biomarkers are available to diagnose NCGS and the gold standard double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge is clinically impractical. The aim of our work was to investigate the role of serum zonulin as a diagnostic biomarker of NCGS and to develop a diagnostic algorithm. Design In a multicentre study, we enrolled 86 patients with either self-reported or double-blind confirmed NCGS, 59 patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 15 patients with CD and 25 asymptomatic controls (AC). Zonulin serum levels were assessed and the associated diagnostic power calculated. Clinical and symptomatic data were recorded. The effect of diet on zonulin levels was evaluated in a subgroup of patients with NCGS. Results Compared with ACs, the NCGS, irrespective of modality of diagnosis, and patients with CD had significantly increased levels of zonulin, as did both NCGS and patients with CD compared with participants with IBS-D. Self-reported NCGS showed increased zonulin levels compared with double-blind confirmed and not-confirmed NCGS. Six-month wheat avoidance significantly reduced zonulin levels only in HLA-DQ2/8-positive participants with NCGS. The diagnostic accuracy of zonulin levels in distinguishing NCGS from IBS-D was 81%. After exclusion of CD, a diagnostic algorithm combining zonulin levels, symptoms and gender improved the accuracy to 89%. Conclusion Zonulin can be considered a diagnostic biomarker in NCGS and combined with demographic and clinical data differentiates NCGS from IBS-D with high accuracy. Wheat withdrawal was associated with a reduction in zonulin levels only in NCGS carrying HLA genotype.  ©

AB  - Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) has been identified in intestinal mucosal eosinophils and associated with psychological stress and gut dysfunction. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is commonly characterized by altered intestinal motility, immune activation, and increased gut barrier permeability along with heightened susceptibility to psychosocial stress. Despite intensive research, the role of mucosal eosinophils in stress-associated gut dysfunction remains uncertain. In this study, we evaluated eosinophil activation profile and CRF content in the jejunal mucosa of diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) and healthy controls (HC) by gene/protein expression and transmission electron microscopy. We also explored the association between intestinal eosinophil CRF and chronic stress, and the potential mechanisms underlying the stress response by assessing eosinophil response to neuropeptides. We found that mucosal eosinophils displayed higher degranulation profile in IBS-D as compared to HC, with increased content of CRF in the cytoplasmic granules, which significantly correlated with IBS clinical severity, life stress background and depression. Eosinophils responded to substance P and carbachol by increasing secretory activity and CRF synthesis and release, without promoting pro-inflammatory activity, a profile similar to that found in mucosal eosinophils from IBS-D. Collectively, our results suggest that intestinal mucosal eosinophils are potential contributors to stress-mediated gut dysfunction through CRF production and release. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized with abdominal pain, bloat-ing, and changes in bowel habits, and dealing with IBS is still a clinical challenge. The pathogenesis of IBS has been reported to be linked to low-grade mucosal inflammation, and macrophages contribute to the pathological process of this disease. Kurarinone (KAR), a flavanoid derived from Sophora flavescens, has been found medically effective in many inflammatory conditions and cancers. KAR was previously reported to inhibit LPS-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, whether and how KAR regulates the functions of macrophage in IBS remains to be elusive. Methods: We established a TNBS-induced IBS mouse model, in which KAR was administrated, and mucosal cytokine expression was measured by qRT-PCR. Additionally, mouse macrophages were generated in vitro and their responses to LPS were evaluated by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR. AhR+/+ or AhR−/- macrophages were transferred into DTx-treated CD11b-DTR transgenic mice to investigate the role of AhR in IBS. We collected colonic biopsies and peripheral blood samples from 64 patients with IBS, and analyzed AhR expression by qRT-PCR. Results: We found KAR effectively alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and maintained intestinal barrier functions in mice with IBS. KAR inhibited LPS-induced macrophage activation and expression of pro-inflammatory genes, while increased anti-inflammatory gene expression including IL-10 in an AhR-dependent manner. Using macrophage-depleted mice, we found that chimera mice with AhR−/- macrophages were more susceptible to TNBS-induced IBS and the therapeutic effect of KAR on IBS was significantly impaired in mice with AhR−/- macrophages. Additionally, we found AhR expression in macrophages of IBS patients was associated with the disease severity. Conclusion: Our findings provide new evidences that KAR regulates IBS development via macrophage-intrinsic AhR. KAR might show promise as an immunomodulatory therapeutic agent in treating IBS. © 2021 Xu et al. This work is published and licensed by Dove Medical Press Limited.

AB  - Grape seed extract (GSE) is rich in polyphenols composed mainly of proanthocyanidins, which are known to attenuate proinflammatory cytokine production. Repeated water avoidance stress (WAS) induces visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and proinflammatory cytokine pathways, which is a rat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) model. Thus, we explored the effects of GSE on repeated WAS (1 h for 3 days)-induced visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability in Sprague-Dawley rats. Paracellular permeability, as evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance and flux of carboxyfluorescein, was analyzed in Caco-2 cell monolayers treated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β. WAS caused visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability, and intragastric administration of GSE (100 mg/kg, once daily for 11 days) inhibited these changes. Furthermore, GSE also suppressed the elevated colonic levels of IL-6, TLR4, and claudin-2 caused by WAS. Paracellular permeability was increased in Caco-2 cell monolayers in the presence of IL-6 and IL-1β, which was inhibited by GSE. Additionally, GSE suppressed the claudin-2 expression elevated by cytokine stimulation. The effects of GSE on visceral changes appear to be evoked by suppressing colonic TLR4-cytokine signaling and maintaining tight junction integrity. GSE may be useful for treating IBS. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The study of intestinal microbiota is an important and current subject. It is well known that the gut microbiota plays a decisive role in the development of intestinal function, contributes to the defense against different infections, gives tolerance to ingested foods, regulating and maintaining the function of the intestinal barrier. The gut microbiota is different from individual to individual, determining, through the molecular profile, an “individual profile”. Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with multiple diseases such as IBD, irritable bowel syndrome, nosocomial infections or rheumatic inflammatory disorders. By characterizing intestinal dysbiosis in patients, a link could be made between these bacteria and the pathogenic mechanisms of the diseases, assigning these structures key roles in the onset of systemic disorders. This allows a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the diseases and allow having a targeted treatment aimed at improving dysbiosis and restoring the normal microbial gut profile. © 2019, Amaltea Medical Publishing House.

AB  - Orexins are neuropeptides that are implicated in a number of functions. With regard to the gastrointestinal functions, orexin acts centrally to regulate gastric secretion, gastrointestinal motility and visceral sensation. Little is however known about a role of central orexin in the control of intestinal barrier function. The present study was performed to clarify whether brain orexin plays a role in the control of intestinal permeability. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in rats. Intracisternally administered orexin-A but not orexin-B dose-dependently blocked the increased intestinal permeability by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or corticotropin-releasing factor while intraperitoneally injected orexin-A failed to block it. Atropine or vagotomy abolished the action by central orexin-A. Intravenous injection of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a central vagal stimulant, significantly blocked the LPS-induced increase in intestinal permeability and atropine prevented the action of 2-DG. Intracisternal injection of SB-334687, a selective orexin 1 receptor antagonist, significantly blocked the action of 2-DG-induced improvement of intestinal hyperpermeability. These results suggest that exogenously administered or endogenously released orexin acts centrally to improve the intestinal hyperpermeability by LPS via the vagal cholinergic pathway. The findings also suggest for the first time that the brain could control intestinal permeability. The neuronal rapid protective advantage to the host by improving the intestinal barrier function by the neuropeptide may help us understand the brain-gut interaction in stress sensitive gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome associated with the altered intestinal permeability. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - WangShiBoChiWan (WSBCW) is a commonly used Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, its preclinical efficacy and the mechanisms of action have not been adequately studied. The goals of this study were to evaluate the effects of WSBCW on gastrointestinal health and modulation of related biomarkers. Female C57BL mice were randomly assigned into one of the experimental groups consisting of the control, drug controls, and WSBCW at 40, 120, and 360 mg/kg BW. Whole gut transit, small intestinal motility, and intestinal barrier permeability were determined. The castor oil-induced diarrhea mouse model was used to determine the effect of WSBCW on the diarrhea type of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). WSBCW increased whole gut transit and intestinal motility, improved intestinal permeability in healthy animals and alleviated diarrhea symptoms in IBS-D mice. WSBCW upregulated intestinal junction proteins, increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium genus, Desulfovibrio genus and inhibited Bacteroides fragillis group in the gut microbiota, increased intestinal villi lengths, and decreased blood levels of inflammatory cytokines. Our study provided preclinical evidence to verify the effectiveness of WSBCW in gastrointestinal health and elucidate mechanistic insights. The results warrant further investigations to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of WSBCW on gastrointestinal disorders, such as IBS and IBD. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects approximately 11.2% of the population. Yet, full understanding of its etiology and optimal treatment remains elusive. Understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of IBS has been limited. However, research is beginning to identify the cause as multifactorial (e.g., low-grade local mucosal inflammation, systemic immune activation, altered intestinal permeability, intestinal hypersensitivity, altered central nervous system processing, changes in intestinal microbiota). Understanding of the role of vitamin D in intestinal inflammation, immunity, and gastrointestinal conditions is increasing but is not yet fully understood. Growing evidence has linked vitamin D deficiency with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, and IBS. Several studies have demonstrated that individuals with IBS are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency than healthy controls. Recent vitamin D supplementation studies have shown improvement in quality of life and reduction in IBS symptoms (including abdominal pain, distention, flatulence, constipation, and visceral sensitivity) but the mechanism remains unclear. Nurses are well positioned to educate patients about the importance of sufficient vitamin D for overall health in individuals with IBS as well as participate in well-designed therapeutic studies to explore whether enhanced vitamin D status will ultimately help treat IBS more effectively.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent chronic abdominal pain and impaired bowel habits, which affects daily activity and work productivity, and is associated with a significant healthcare economic burden as well as an impaired quality of life and psycho-affective profile. Management of patients is a great challenge for physicians; at the present, the therapeutic strategy aimed to treat the different symptoms, and no medical therapy is proven to modify the natural history of the disease. GELSECTAN® (xyloglucan, pea protein and tannins, xylo-oligosaccharides) is a medical device with both protective and prebiotic actions on the intestinal mucosa, able to restore intestinal permeability and to improve gastrointestinal symptoms, controlling diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome. We report and discuss four cases of different patients with irritable bowel syndrome successfully managed with Gelsectan in the real clinical practice. Literature data, as well as these case reports, show that this device is effective and safe in improving symptoms and bowel habits associated to irritable bowel syndrome; its efficacy and safety were confirmed for the long-term use too. Agents with film-forming protective properties, such as Gelsectan, represent a new alternative therapeutic option for the management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. © 2021 Bellini et al.

AB  - BackgroundThe totality of bacteria, protozoa, viruses and fungi that lives in the human body is called microbiota. Human microbiota specifically colonizes the skin, the respiratory and urinary tract, the urogenital tract and the gastrointestinal system. This study focuses on the intestinal microbiota to explore the drug-microbiota relationship and, therefore, how the drug bioavailability changes in relation to the microbiota biodiversity to identify more personalized therapies, with the minimum risk of side effects. MethodsTo achieve this goal, we developed a new mathematical model with two compartments, the intestine and the blood, which takes into account the colonic mucosal permeability variation - measured by Ussing chamber system on human colonic mucosal biopsies - and the fecal microbiota composition, determined through microbiota 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. Both of the clinical parameters were evaluated in a group of Irritable Bowel Syndrome patients compared to a group of healthy controls. Key ResultsThe results show that plasma drug concentration increases as bacterial concentration decreases, while it decreases as intestinal length decreases too. ConclusionsThe study provides interesting data since in literature there are not yet mathematical models with these features, in which the importance of intestinal microbiota, the ”forgotten organ”, is considered both for the subject health state and in the nutrients and drugs metabolism. © 2021

AB  - We have determined whether orange juice-derived nanovesicles (ONVs) could be used for the treatment of obesity-associated intestinal complications. ONVs were characterized by lipidomic, metabolomic, electron microscopy. In vitro, intestinal barriers (IBs = Caco-2+HT-29-MTX) were treated with ONVs and co-cultured with adipocytes to monitor IB fat release. In vivo, obesity was induced with a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD mice) for 12 weeks. Then, half of HFHSD mice were gavaged with ONVs. One-month ONV treatment did not modify HFHSD-induced insulin resistance but reversed diet-induced gut modifications. In the jejunum, ONVs increased villi size, reduced triglyceride content, and modulated mRNA levels of genes involved in immune response (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α and interleukin [IL]-1β), barrier permeability (CLDN1, OCLN, ZO1), fat absorption, and chylomicron release. ONVs targeted microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and angiopoietin-like protein-4 (ANGPTL4), two therapeutic targets to reduce plasma lipids and inflammation in gastrointestinal diseases. Interestingly, ONV treatment did not aggravate liver steatosis, as MTP mRNA was increased in the liver. Therefore, ONVs protected both intestine and the liver from fat overload associated with the HFHSD. As ONVs concentrated amino acids and bioactive lipids versus orange juice, which are deficient in obese patients, the use of ONVs as a dietary supplement could bring physiological relevant compounds in the jejunum to accelerate the restoration of intestinal functions during weight loss in obese patients. © 2020 The Authors; This study demonstrated that orange juice-derived nanovesicles (ONVs) reversed diet-induced gut modifications in mice. ONVs increased villi size, reduced triglyceride content, and modulated genes involved in the immune response, barrier permeability, fat absorption, and chylomicron release. ONVs also protected both intestine and liver from fat overload by targeting MTP and ANGPTL4. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Background and Aim: Emerging evidence indicates that psychological stress is involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, which is characterized by visceral hypersensitivity and may be accompanied by gut dysbiosis. However, how such stress contributes to the development of visceral hypersensitivity is incompletely understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the influence that stress-induced microbial changes exert on visceral sensitivity, as well as the possible underlying mechanisms associated with this effect. Methods: Male Sprague–Dawley rats underwent chronic water avoidance stress (WAS) to induce visceral hypersensitivity. Visceral sensitivity, colonic tight junction protein expression, and short-chain fatty acids of cecal contents were measured. Fecal samples were collected to characterize microbiota profiles. In a separate study, oral gavage of Roseburia in WAS rats was conducted to verify its potential role in the effectiveness on visceral hypersensitivity. Results: Repeated WAS caused visceral hypersensitivity, altered fecal microbiota composition and function, and decreased occludin expression in the colon. Stressed rats exhibited reduced representation of pathways involved in the metabolism of butyrate and reduced abundance of several operational taxonomic units associated with butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Lachnospiraceae. Consistently, supplementation with Roseburia hominis, a species belonging to Lachnospiraceae, significantly increased cecal butyrate content. Moreover, Roseburia supplementation alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and prevented the decreased expression of occludin. Conclusions: Reduction in the abundance of butyrate-producing Lachnospiraceae, which is beneficial for the intestinal barrier, was involved in the formation of visceral hypersensitivity. R. hominis is a potential probiotic for treating stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Stress-induced altered visceral sensation and impaired gut barrier play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These responses were demonstrated to be peripheral corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) dependent and also mediated via proinflammatory cytokine in animal IBS model. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is known to have anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine release. We hypothesized that DHEA-S improves stress-induced visceral changes and is beneficial for IBS treatment. We explored the effects of DHEA-S on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or repeated water avoidance stress (WAS)-induced visceral allodynia and increased colonic permeability (rat IBS models). The threshold of visceromotor response, i.e. abdominal muscle contractions induced by colonic balloon distention was electrophysiologically measured. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue. DHEA-S abolished visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. It also blocked repeated WAS- or peripheral injection of CRF-induced visceral changes. These effects by DHEA-S in LPS model were reversed by bicuculline, a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor antagonist, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor, naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, or sulpiride, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. However, domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist did not modify the effects. Peripheral injection of astressin2-B, a selective CRF receptor subtype 2 (CRF2) antagonist also reversed these effects. In conclusion, DHEA-S blocked stress-induced visceral changes via GABAA, NO, opioid, central dopamine D2 and peripheral CRF2 signaling. DHEA-S may be useful for IBS treating. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pyruvate is a normal constituent of the body that participates in carbohydrate metabolism and functions as a scavenger of free radicals. Calcium pyruvate monohydrate (CPM) is a more stable derivative that has proved its anti-inflammatory effect in experimental colitis, among other disorders, and that could also be considered a source of calcium. Thus, it would be useful for the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory component and a high prevalence of osteoporosis like the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of CPM in a rat model of chronic post-inflammatory visceral pain induced by deoxycholic acid (DCA) that resembles IBS. Rats were administered DCA for three days intracolonically and then treated daily with CPM (40 and 100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) (positive control) by oral gavage for 17 days. The treatments reduced the visceral hypersensitivity measured by response to colorectal distension and referred pain. DCA induced changes in the colonic immune response characterized by increased expression of the cytokine Il-1β and the inducible enzyme Cox-2, which was reduced by the treatments. DCA also decreased the gut expression of the mucins Muc-2 and Muc-3, which was normalized by CPM, whereas gabapentin only increased significantly Muc-3. Moreover, DCA increased the expression of Tlr3, which was decreased to basal levels by all the treatments. However, the serotonin receptor Htr-4, which was also elevated, was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating no effect through this signalling pathway. In conclusion, CPM ameliorated the visceral hypersensitivity and the referred pain caused by DCA, being as effective as the control drug. Furthermore, it improved the immune status of the animals, which could contribute to the visceral analgesia and the regeneration of the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. © 2019, MDPI AG.

AB  - Background: Enteric glial cells (EGC) and mast cells (MC) are intimately associated with gastrointestinal physiological functions. We aimed to investigate EGC-MC interaction in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a gut-brain disorder linked to increased intestinal permeability, and MC. Methods: Parallel approaches were used to quantify EGC markers in colonic biopsies from healthy controls (HC) and patients with IBS. Data were correlated with MC, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and VIP receptors (VPAC1/VPAC2) expressions, and bacterial translocation through biopsies mounted in Ussing chambers. In addition, we investigated the effects of EGC mediators on colonic permeability and the pharmacological-induced responses of EGC and MC cell lines. Key Results: Immunofluorescence of IBS colonic mucosa, as well as Western blotting and ELISA of IBS biopsy lysates, revealed increased glial fibrillary intermediate filament (GFAP) expression, indicating EGC activation. Mucosal GFAP correlated with increased MC and VPAC1+MC numbers and decreased VIP+MC, which seemed to control bacterial translocation in HC. In the contrary, EGC activation in IBS correlated with less MC and VPAC1+ MC numbers, and more VIP+ MC. In vitro, MC and EGC cell lines showed intracellular calcium responses to each other's mediators. Furthermore, EGC mediators prevented VIP-induced MC degranulation, while MC mediators induced a reactive EGC phenotype. In Ussing chambers, EGC mediators decreased paracellular passage through healthy colonic biopsies. Conclusions & Inferences: Findings suggest the involvement of EGC and MC in the control of barrier function in the human colon and indicate a potential EGC-MC interaction that seems altered in IBS, with detrimental consequences to colonic permeability. Altogether, results suggest that imbalanced EGC-MC communication contributes to the pathophysiology of IBS. © 2021 The Authors. Neurogastroenterology & Motility published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (LFD) improves both gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the psychological profile of patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). The effects of 12 weeks of LFD on GI symptom and psychological profiles in relation to inflammation and the involvement of the intestinal barrier were studied in twenty IBS-D patients. The IBS Severity Scoring System, the Symptom Checklist-90-Re-vised, the Italian version of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, the IBS-Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire, and the Psychophysiological questionnaire were administered. The GI barrier function was assessed by sugar absorption test, the serum and fecal zonulin levels, and the serum levels of intestinal fatty-acid binding protein and diamine oxidase. Interleukins (ILs) and lipopolysaccha-ride (LPS) serum levels were evaluated along with dysbiosis. At the end of LFD, GI symptoms, psychological state (mainly anxiety, somatization, psychoticism, and interpersonal sensitivity), and QoL significantly improved in these patients. Simultaneously, an improvement in small intestinal permeability and intestinal mucosal integrity occurred, while IL-6, Il-10, LPS, and fermentative dysbiosis significantly decreased. The LFD can modify the immune-inflammatory features and en-hance intestinal permeability and mucosal integrity, thus determining a concurrent improvement in the clinical and psychological conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI disorders are associated with altered intestinal permeability, which can be measured in vivo by urinary excretion after oral lactulose and mannitol ingestion. Inadvertent dietary consumption of 12Carbon (12C, regular) mannitol in food or from other sources may interfere with the test's interpretation. 13Carbon (13C) constitutes 1% of carbon in nature and 13C mannitol is a stable isotope. Our aim was to determine the performance of 13C mannitol for measurement of intestinal permeability. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers underwent intestinal permeability assay using coadministered 12C mannitol, 13C mannitol and lactulose, followed by timed urine collections. Urinary sugar concentrations were measured using tandem high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Key results: We found that 13C mannitol can be distinguishable from 12C mannitol on tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, 13C mannitol had ~20-fold lower baseline contamination compared to 12C mannitol. We describe here the 13C mannitol assay method for the measurement of intestinal permeability. Conclusions & Inferences: In conclusion, 13C mannitol is superior to 12C mannitol for measurement of intestinal permeability. It avoids issues with baseline contamination and erratic excretions during the testing period. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - For decades, interactions between the enteric neuromuscular apparatus and the central nervous system have served as the primary focus of pathophysiological research in the functional gastrointestinal disorders. The accumulation of patient reports, as well as clinical observations, has belatedly led to an interest in the role of various luminal factors and their interactions with each other and the host in functional gastrointestinal disorders. Most prominent among these factors has been the role of food. As a consequence, although not always evidence-based, dietary interventions are enjoying a renaissance in irritable bowel syndrome management. Not surprisingly, given its exploration in many disease states, the gut microbiota has also been studied in functional gastrointestinal disorders; data remain inconclusive. Likewise, there is also a considerable body of experimental and some clinical data to link the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders to disturbances in epithelial barrier integrity, abnormal enteroendocrine signaling, and immune activation. These data provide growing evidence supporting the existence of micro-organic changes, particularly in subgroups of patients with functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. However, their exact role in the complex pathophysiology and symptom generation of functional gastrointestinal disorders needs to be further studied and elucidated, particularly with longitudinal and interventional studies. © 2016 by the AGA Institute.

AB  - Giardia duodenalis is a prevalent cause of acute diarrheal disease worldwide. However, recent outbreaks in Italy and Norway have revealed a link between giardiasis and the subsequent development of chronic post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. While the mechanisms underlying the causation of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome remain obscure, recent findings suggest that alterations in gut microbiota communities are linked to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome. In the present study, we use a laboratory biofilm system to culture and enrich mucosal microbiota from human intestinal biopsies. Subsequently, we show that co-culture with Giardia induces disturbances in biofilm species composition and biofilm structure resulting in microbiota communities that are intrinsically dysbiotic – even after the clearance of Giardia. These microbiota abnormalities were mediated in part by secretory-excretory Giardia cysteine proteases. Using in vitro cell culture and germ-free murine infection models, we show that Giardia-induced disruptions of microbiota promote bacterial invasion, resulting in epithelial apoptosis, tight junctional disruption, and bacterial translocation across an intestinal epithelial barrier. Additionally, these dysbiotic microbiota communities resulted in increased activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 signalling pathway, and overproduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in humanized germ-free mice. Previous studies that have sought explanations and risk factors for the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome have focused on features of enteropathogens and attributes of the infected host. We propose that polymicrobial interactions involving Giardia and gut microbiota may cause persistent dysbiosis, offering a new interpretation of the reasons why those afflicted with giardiasis are predisposed to gastrointestinal disorders post-infection. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Intestinal homeostasis is a dynamic process that takes place at the interface between the lumen and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, where a constant scrutiny for antigens and toxins derived from food and microorganisms is carried out by the vast gut-associated immune system. Intestinal homeostasis is preserved by the ability of the mucus layer and the mucosal barrier to keep the passage of small-sized and antigenic molecules across the epithelium highly selective. When combined and preserved, immune surveillance and barrier's selective permeability, the host capacity of preventing the development of intestinal inflammation is optimized, and viceversa. In addition, the brain-gut-microbiome axis, a multidirectional communication system that integrates distant and local regulatory networks through neural, immunological, metabolic, and hormonal signaling pathways, also regulates intestinal function. Dysfunction of the brain-gut-microbiome axis may induce the loss of gut mucosal homeostasis, leading to uncontrolled permeation of toxins and immunogenic particles, increasing the risk of appearance of intestinal inflammation, mucosal damage, and gut disorders. Irritable bowel syndrome is prevalent stress-sensitive gastrointestinal disorder that shows a female predominance. Interestingly, the role of stress, sex and gonadal hormones in the regulation of intestinal mucosal and the brain-gut-microbiome axis functioning is being increasingly recognized. Purpose: We aim to critically review the evidence linking sex, and stress to intestinal barrier and brain-gut-microbiome axis dysfunction and the implications for irritable bowel syndrome. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play a vital role in the homeostatic regulation of intestinal barrier integrity. We aimed to investigate the physiological role of BDNF in maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier using postinflammatory irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) mice and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms using intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Methods: Postinflammatory-IBS mice were induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and allowed to recover for 28 days. Frequency of defecation, fecal water content, colonic epithelial integrity and expressions of BDNF and tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin, ZO-1, claudin-1, claudin-2) of the PI-IBS mice were investigated. Based on the results of animal studies, we further performed RT-PCR and Western blots to assess how BDNF stimulation and BDNF knockdown impacted TJ proteins in the ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells. Key Results: Water content of stools was significantly increased in the PI-IBS mice compared with controls. Colonic mucosa from the PI-IBS mice displayed epithelial barrier defects and exhibited increased protein expressions of BDNF and claudin-2 and decreased protein expressions of occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-1. Furthermore, a siRNA against BDNF in the ht-29 cells could effectively suppress BDNF gene and protein expressions, and subsequently reduce TJ gene and protein levels. When the ht-29 cells were incubated with different doses of exogenous BDNF, significant increases of occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-1 and decreases of claudin-2 protein were observed. Conclusions & Inferences: BDNF may play a role in regulating intestinal epithelial barrier via affecting the expression of TJ proteins. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and IBDs are two of the most prevalent disorders of the GI tract and consume a significant proportion of healthcare resources. Recent studies have shown that membrane-bound guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) receptors lining the GI tract may serve as novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of FGIDs and IBDs. GC-C receptor activation by its endogenous paracrine hormones uroguanylin and guanylin, and the resulting intracellular production of its downstream effector cyclic GMP, occurs in a pH-dependent manner and modulates key physiological functions. These include fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, maintenance of the intestinal barrier, anti-inflammatory activity and regulation of epithelial regeneration. Studies of the GC-C paracrine signalling axis have revealed the therapeutic potential of these receptors in treating GI disorders, including chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome-constipation. This review focuses on the evolving understanding of GC-C function in health and disease, and strategies for translating these principles into new treatments for FGIDs and IBDs. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract consists of an enormous surface area that is optimized to efficiently absorb nutrients, water, and electrolytes from food. At the same time, it needs to provide a tight barrier against the ingress of harmful substances, and protect against a reaction to omnipresent harmless compounds. A dysfunctional intestinal barrier is associated with various diseases and disorders. In this review, the role of intestinal permeability in common disorders such as infections with intestinal pathogens, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and food allergies will be discussed. In addition, the effect of the frequently prescribed drugs proton pump inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on intestinal permeability, as well as commonly used methods to assess barrier function will be reviewed. © 2016 the American College of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Objective: Our research was to detect the expression of aquaporins. NF-κB in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rat models' colon so as to find novel pathogenesisof IBS. Results: The expression of AQP1, AQP3, and AQP8 of IBS model group was downregulated while NF-κB p65 was up-regulated comparing with control group (p < 0.05), and the expression of AQP1, AQP3, and AQP8 of inhibitor group was up-regulated while NF-κB p65 was down-regulated comparing with IBS model group (p < 0.05). Materials and Methods: 18 adult female SD big rats were divided into three groups:the rats in control group were normal rats,the rats in IBS model group and the rats of inhibitor group were injected with the inhibitor of NF-κB (PDTC). Immunohistochemical technique and western blot were performed to detect the expression of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8 and NF-κB p65. RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of AQP1, AQP3, and AQP8. Conclusions: Liquid water metabolic abnormalities and intestine permeability alteration might be the mechanism of IBS by down-regulating AQP1, AQP3 and AQP8 via NF-κB pathway. © Chao et al.

AB  - Guanylyl cyclase-C (GC-C) agonists increase cGMP levels in the intestinal epithelium to promote secretion. This process underlies the utility of exogenous GC-C agonists such as linaclotide for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Because GC-C agonists have limited use in pediatric patients, there is a need for alternative cGMP-elevating agents that are effective in the intestine. The present study aimed to determine whether the PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil has similar effects as linaclotide on preclinical models of constipation. Oral administration of sildenafil caused increased cGMP levels in mouse intestinal epithelium demonstrating that blocking cGMP-breakdown is an alternative approach to increase cGMP in the gut. Both linaclotide and sildenafil reduced proliferation and increased differentiation in colon mucosa, indicating common target pathways. The homeostatic effects of cGMP required gut turnover since maximal effects were observed after 3 days of treatment. Neither linaclotide nor sildenafil treatment affected intestinal transit or water content of fecal pellets in healthy mice. To test the effectiveness of cGMP elevation in a functional motility disorder model, mice were treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis and were allowed to recover for several weeks. The recovered animals exhibited slower transit, but increased fecal water content. An acute dose of sildenafil was able to normalize transit and fecal water content in the DSS-recovery animal model, and also in loperamide-induced constipation. The higher fecal water content in the recovered animals was due to a compromised epithelial barrier, which was normalized by sildenafil treatment. Taken together our results show that sildenafil can have similar effects as linaclotide on the intestine, and may have therapeutic benefit to patients with CIC, IBS-C, and post-infectious IBS. © 2017 Sharman et al.

AB  - Background Altered intestinal permeability in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) has been reported in some studies. Aims The study aimed to investigate the altered intestinal permeability and its associated clinical characteristics and RNA expression profiles in IBS-D. Methods We stratified IBS-D patients into two groups according to the P95 value of the permeability in controls. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were evaluated, and two biopsy cases from each of the two groups were selected for the RNA-seq analysis. Results IBS-D patients had a significant increase in the small intestinal permeability compared with controls [0.0245 (0.0229) median (interquartile range)] versus 0.0156 (0.0098), P = 0.010), but no significant difference was found in the colonic permeability [23.286 (10.470) versus 21.650 (6.650), P = 0.574]. The IBS-D patients with increased small intestinal permeability had worse psychological effects (P = 0.027) and quality of life (P = 0.044). Analysis of RNA-seq data revealed 185 genes differentially expressed, many of which were related to mucosal inflammation and immunity. Conclusions Small intestinal permeability, but not colonic permeability, is increased in IBS-D patients. IBS-D patients with increased small intestinal permeability tend to be more severely impaired in terms of psychological effects and quality of life, and analysis of RNA-seq data reveals that increased small intestinal permeability is related to mucosal inflammation and immunity. © 2016 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

AB  - Background & Aims: Functional gastrointestinal disorders are prevalent worldwide and alterations of gut-brain axis and intestinal barrier integrity may play a pivotal role in both the pathophysiology and clinical course of these bowel malfunctions. We aimed to assess the prevalence of abdominal pain in a selected adult population of Poland to determine potential environmental factors associated with gastrointestinal complaints. Methods: There were 1479 individuals-657 women (44.42%) and 822 men (55.58%), aged 24.20±6.08 years. The responders fulfilled an authors’ questionnaire based on Rome II and III criteria focused on the abdominal pain prevalence and environmental factors involved in its occurrence. Results: The frequency of abdominal pain was found to be as high as 19.2%. Male gender (n=822) and basic education level (n=151) lowered the risk of abdominal pain occurrence (OR=0.7, p<0.012 and OR=0.5, p<0.021, respectively). Psychological distress, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and antibiotics usage were found as risk factors of abdominal pain (OR=2.503, p<0.01; OR=3.308, p<0.01; OR=3.105, p<0.01, respectively). Conclusions: Abdominal pain is prevalent in young adult inhabitants of Poland, especially in women. Intense psychological stress, as well as PPIs and antibiotics usage elevate the risk. © 2018, Romanian Society of Gastroenterology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Intestinal permeability is altered in a subgroup of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and may contribute to symptom development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effect of the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) on Caco-2 permeability alterations induced by mediators released by IBS mucosal biopsies compared to asymptomatic controls (AC). Methods: Caco-2 cells were used as an in vitro model of intestinal permeability. Seven AC and 28 well-phenotyped IBS (9 IBS-D, 8 IBS-C, and 11 IBS-M) patients were enrolled. Mucosal mediators spontaneously released (SUP) by IBS and AC biopsies were collected. Two concentrations of EcN (108 and 106) were applied to Caco-2 with or without SUP or SLIGRL (a protease-activated receptor-2 activating peptide), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ. Paracellular permeability was assessed by evaluating the flow of sulfonic-acid conjugated to fluorescein through Caco-2 monolayer. Key Results: EcN 108 significantly reinforced Caco-2 monolayer compared to cells incubated with medium alone. IBS SUP induced a significant increase in paracellular permeability compared to AC SUP, independently of IBS bowel habit. EcN 108 induced a significant recovery of permeability rate compared to IBS SUP. Permeability increase induced by IBS SUP significantly correlated with severity and frequency of abdominal pain and abdominal distension. The co-incubation of EcN and IBS SUP abolished the above significant correlations. Conclusions and Inferences: EcN reinforces the integrity of Caco-2 monolayer and reverts the increase of permeability induced by mediators released by IBS biopsies. Future studies should investigate EcN therapeutic potentials in IBS. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder with multifactorial pathophysiology. Intestinal barrier may be altered, especially in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Several mediators may contribute to increased intestinal permeability in IBS. Aim We aimed to assess effects of tryptase and LPS on in vitro permeability using a 3- dimensional cell model after basolateral cell exposure. Furthermore, we assessed the extent to which these mediators in IBS plasma play a role in intestinal barrier function. Materials and Methods Caco-2 cells were grown in extracellular matrix to develop into polarized spheroids and were exposed to tryptase (10 - 50 mU), LPS (1 - 50 ng/mL) and two-fold diluted plasma samples of 7 patients with IBS-D, 7 with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and 7 healthy controls (HC). Barrier function was assessed by the flux of FITC-dextran (FD4) using live cell imaging. Furthermore, plasma tryptase and LPS were determined. Results Tryptase (20 and 50 mU) and LPS (6.25 - 50 ng/mL) significantly increased Caco-2 permeability versus control (all P< 0.05). Plasma of IBS-D only showed significantly elevated median tryptase concentrations (7.1 [3.9 - 11.0] vs. 4.2 [2.2 - 7.0] vs. 4.2 [2.5 - 5.9] μg/mL; P<0.05) and LPS concentrations (3.65 [3.00 - 6.10] vs. 3.10 [2.60-3.80] vs. 2.65 [2.40 - 3.40] EU/ml; P< 0.05) vs. IBS-C and HC. Also, plasma of IBS-D increased Caco-2 permeability versus HC (0.14450 ± 0.00472 vs. 0.00021 ± 0.00003; P < 0.001), which was attenuated by selective inhibition of tryptase and LPS (P< 0.05). Conclusion Basolateral exposure of spheroids to plasma of IBS-D patients resulted in a significantly increased FD4 permeation, which was partially abolished by selective inhibition of tryptase and LPS. These findings point to a role of systemic tryptase and LPS in the epithelial barrier alterations observed in patients with IBS-D.  © 2015 Ludidi et al.

AB  - Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum MTCC 5690, a probiotic strain of Indian gut origin, and milk formulations produced with the same were explored in this study as biotherapeutics by evaluating their functional efficacy against Salmonella infection in mice. The efficacy of milk formulations (fermented/unfermented) of MTCC 5690 for enhancement of intestinal barrier function was determined by monitoring the permeability and histopathology of the intestine. Infected mice fed with probiotic Dahi, fermented probiotic drink and sweetened fermented probiotic drink maintained the health and integrity of the intestinal epithelium as compared to those fed with PBS, milk, unfermented probiotic milk and Dahi. Our relative expression data revealed that the changes caused by MTCC 5690 in intestinal barrier function components were established through modulation of the key regulatory receptors Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4. The results suggest that fermented milks of MTCC 5690 could enhance the defences of the intestinal barrier in enteric infection condition and, therefore, can be explored as a dietary-based strategy to reduce Salmonella infection in the human gut. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Background & Aims We sought to determine the efficacy of psyllium fiber treatment on abdominal pain and stool patterns in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We evaluated effects on breath hydrogen and methane production, gut permeability, and microbiome composition. We also investigated whether psychological characteristics of children or parents affected the response to treatment. Methods We performed a randomized, double-blind trial of 103 children (mean age, 13 ± 3 y) with IBS seen at primary or tertiary care settings. After 2 weeks on their habitual diet, children began an 8-day diet excluding carbohydrates thought to cause symptoms of IBS. Children with ≥75% improvement in abdominal pain were excluded (n = 17). Children were assigned randomly to groups given psyllium (n = 37) or placebo (maltodextrin, n = 47) for 6 weeks. Two-week pain and stool diaries were compared at baseline and during the final 2 weeks of treatment. We assessed breath hydrogen and methane production, intestinal permeability, and the composition of the microbiome before and after administration of psyllium or placebo. Psychological characteristics of children were measured at baseline. Results Children in the psyllium group had a greater reduction in the mean number of pain episodes than children in the placebo group (mean reduction of 8.2 ± 1.2 after receiving psyllium vs mean reduction of 4.1 ± 1.3 after receiving placebo; P = .03); the level of pain intensity did not differ between the groups. Psychological characteristics were not associated with response. At the end of the study period, the percentage of stools that were normal (Bristol scale scores, 3–5), breath hydrogen or methane production, intestinal permeability, and microbiome composition were similar between groups. Conclusions Psyllium fiber reduced the number of abdominal pain episodes in children with IBS, independent of psychological factors. Psyllium did not alter breath hydrogen or methane production, gut permeability, or microbiome composition. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00526903. © 2017 AGA Institute

AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are characterized by chronic complaints arising from disorganized brain-gut interactions leading to dysmotility and hypersensitivity. The two most prevalent FGIDs, affecting up to 16-26% of worldwide population, are functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Their etiopathogenic mechanisms remain unclear, however, recent observations reveal low-grade mucosal inflammation and immune activation, in association with impaired epithelial barrier function and aberrant neuronal sensitivity. These findings come to challenge the traditional view of FGIDs as pure functional disorders, and relate the origin to a tangible organic substrate. The mucosal inflammatory infiltrate is dominated by mast cells, eosinophils and intraepithelial lymphocytes in the intestine of FGIDs. It is well established that mast cell activation can generate epithelial and neuro-muscular dysfunction and promote visceral hypersensitivity and altered motility patterns in FGIDs, postoperative ileus, food allergy and inflammatory bowel disease. This review will discuss the role of mucosal mast cells in the gastrointestinal tract with a specific focus on recent advances in disease mechanisms and clinical management in irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia. © 2016, BMJ Publishing Group.

AB  - Life stress is a major risk factor in the onset and exacerbation of mast cell–associated diseases, including allergy/anaphylaxis, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome. Although it is known that mast cells are highly activated upon stressful events, the mechanisms by which stress modulates mast cell function and disease pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor subtype 1 (CRF1) in mast cell degranulation and associated disease pathophysiology. In a mast cell– dependent model of IgE-mediated passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA), prophylactic administration of the CRF1 -antagonist antalarmin attenuated mast cell degranulation and hypothermia. Mast cell–deficient KitW-sh/W-sh mice engrafted with CRF1-/- bone marrow–derived mast cells (BMMCs) exhibited attenuated PSA-induced serum histamine, hypothermia, and clinical scores compared with wild-type BMMC-engrafted KitW-sh/W-sh mice. KitW-sh/W-sh mice engrafted with CRF1-/- BMMCs also exhibited suppressed in vivo mast cell degranulation and intestinal permeability in response to acute restraint stress. Genetic and pharmacologic experiments with murine BMMCs, rat RBL-2H3, and human LAD2 mast cells demonstrated that although CRF1 activation did not directly induce MC degranulation, CRF1 signaling potentiated the degranulation responses triggered by diverse mast cell stimuli and was associated with enhanced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Taken together, our results revealed a prominent role for CRF1 signaling in mast cells as a positive modulator of stimuli-induced degranulation and in vivo pathophysiologic responses to immunologic and psychologic stress. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.

AB  - The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains unclear. Here we investigated the microbiome of a large cohort of patients to identify specific signatures for IBS subtypes. We examined the microbiome of 113 patients with IBS and 66 healthy controls. A subset of these participants provided two samples one month apart. We analyzed a total of 273 fecal samples, generating more than 20 million 16S rRNA sequences. In patients with IBS, a significantly lower microbial diversity was associated with a lower relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (P=0.002; q<0.06), in particular in patients with IBS-D and IBS-M. IBS patients who did not receive any treatment harboured a lower abundance of Methanobacteria compared to healthy controls (P=0.005; q=0.05). Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between several bacterial taxa and sensation of flatulence and abdominal pain (P<0.05). Altogether, our findings showed that IBS-M and IBS-D patients are characterized by a reduction of butyrate producing bacteria, known to improve intestinal barrier function, and a reduction of methane producing microorganisms a major mechanism of hydrogen disposal in the human colon, which could explain excess of abdominal gas in IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder characterized by altered gut function and often is accompanied by comorbid anxiety. Although changes in the gut microbiota have been documented, their relevance to the clinical expression of IBS is unknown. To evaluate a functional role for commensal gut bacteria in IBS, we colonized germ-free mice with the fecal microbiota from healthy control individuals or IBS patients with diarrhea (IBS-D), with or without anxiety, and monitored gut function and behavior in the transplanted mice. Microbiota profiles in recipient mice clustered according to the microbiota profiles of the human donors. Mice receiving the IBS-D fecal microbiota showed a taxonomically similar microbial composition to that of mice receiving the healthy control fecal microbiota. However, IBS-D mice showed different serum metabolomic profiles. Mice receiving the IBS-D fecal microbiota, but not the healthy control fecal microbiota, exhibited faster gastrointestinal transit, intestinal barrier dysfunction, innate immune activation, and anxiety-like behavior. These results indicate the potential of the gut microbiota to contribute to both intestinal and behavioral manifestations of IBS-D and suggest the potential value of microbiota-directed therapies in IBS patients. © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.

AB  - Although gut microbiota and early life events are likely involved in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it remains unclear how these factors interact in the pathophysiology of IBS. In the present study, using rats subjected to maternal separation (MS) as a model of IBS, we investigated interrelationships among gut microbiota, stress susceptibility and intestinal permeability, and examined the effect of the probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1 (BBG9-1) on those interrelationships. When compared with the controls at postnatal day 20, MS rats showed hypercorticosteronemia, enhanced intestinal permeability and changes in gut microbiota structure. All of these changes in MS rats were prevented by treatment with BBG9-1. Although the gut microbiota profile and basal serum corticosterone level did not differ between MS and control rats at postnatal day 56, MS rats showed hypersensitivity to restraint stress in terms of serum corticosterone level and fecal frequency. However, such hypersensitivity was not observed in MS rats treated with BBG9-1. These findings suggest that MS initiates the link between gut microbiota alteration and hypersensitivity to stress and that the triggering of this process can be prevented by the treatment with the probiotic BBG9-1. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Background. Alterations of the small-intestinal permeability (s-IP) might play an essential role in a subgroup of diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) patients. Goals. (a) To analyse in D-IBS patients the symptom profile in relation to the altered (+) or not (−) s-IP using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). (b) To assess the circulating levels of the adipokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, leptin, and adiponectin, along with LPS, TLR-4, neurotensin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The frequency distribution of SNPs at the loci for the investigated molecules and leptin receptor was evaluated. Study. The study included 34 D-IBS patients and 17 healthy controls (HC). s-IP permeability was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography determination in the urine of the lactulose to mannitol ratio. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, LPS, TLR-4, leptin, adiponectin, neurotensin, and BDNF were assayed by ELISA. Screening of genetic variants was done employing the restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction method. Results. D-IBS(−) patients had a significantly higher GSRS cluster pain and diarrhoea profile than D-IBS(+) ones. Significant correlations were found between the symptoms clusters and immune activation and inflammation markers. The levels of adipo(cyto)kines in D-IBS(+) patients were higher than those of controls, and IL-6 levels correlated with those of LPS. Leptin and BDNF were significantly higher, and neurotensin levels were significantly lower in D-IBS(+) than in controls. No differences were found in the frequency distribution of genotypes among the study groups. Conclusions. Results from this study could be of some help in the characterization of the DIBS and highlight the contribution of an altered intestinal barrier in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. Besides, a role could be ascribed to molecules secreted by the visceral adipose tissue that can impact on barrier functions. Copyright © 2018 Francesco Russo et al.

AB  - Intestinal barrier dysfunction is associated with chronic gastrointestinal tract inflammation and diseases such as IBD and IBS. Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) is a specially formulated protein preparation (>90%) for oral administration. The composition of SBI is greater than 60% immunoglobulin including contributions from IgG, IgA, and IgM. Immunoglobulin within the lumen of the gut has been recognized to have antiinflammatory properties and is involved in maintaining gut homeostasis. The binding of common intestinal antigens (LPS and Lipid A) and the ligand Pam3CSK4, by IgG, IgA, and IgM in SBI was shown using a modified ELISA technique. Each of these antigens stimulated IL-8 and TNF-α cytokine production by THP-1 monocytes. Immune exclusion occurred as SBI (≤50 mg/mL) bound free antigen in a dose dependent manner that inhibited cytokine production by THP-1 monocytes in response to 10 ng/mL LPS or 200 ng/mL Lipid A. Conversely, Pam3CSK4 stimulation of THP-1 monocytes was unaffected by SBI/antigen binding. A co-culture model of the intestinal epithelium consisted of a C2BBe1 monolayer separating an apical compartment from a basal compartment containing THP-1 monocytes. The C2BBe1 monolayer was permeabilized with dimethyl palmitoyl ammonio propanesulfonate (PPS) to simulate a damaged epithelial barrier. Results indicate that Pam3CSK4 was able to translocate across the PPS-damaged C2BBe1 monolayer. However, binding of Pam3CSK4 by immunoglobulins in SBI prevented Pam3CSK4 translocation across the damaged C2BBe1 barrier. These results demonstrated steric exclusion of antigen by SBI which prevented apical to basal translocation of antigen due to changes in the physical properties of Pam3CSK4, most likely as a result of immunoglobulin binding. This study demonstrates that immunoglobulins in SBI can reduce antigen-associated inflammation through immune and steric exclusion mechanisms and furthers the mechanistic understanding of how SBI might improve immune status and reduce inflammation in various intestinal disease states. © 2015 Detzel et al.

AB  - Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) mucositis caused by chemotherapy is associated with diarrhoea and intestinal barrier disruption caused by apoptosis, immune dysfunction and microbiome alterations. Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) has been shown to manage HIV-associated enteropathy and irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D). We investigated in a rat model whether SBI was effective in alleviating symptoms of irinotecan-induced GI mucositis. Methods: Animals were gavaged with 250 or 500 mg/kg of SBI twice daily for 4 days, before intraperitoneal administration of 200 mg/kg irinotecan. Twice daily gavaging of SBI continued for 6 days post-irinotecan. Animals were monitored for bodyweight changes and incidence of diarrhoea and clinical symptoms of stress. Tissues and blood samples were collected at necropsy 6 h, and 2, 4 and 6 days post-irinotecan. H&E-stained colon and jejunum were analysed for histological damage. Results: The overall incidence, severity and duration of diarrhoea, and clinical symptoms of mucositis were decreased in irinotecan-treated animals that had received SBI. Animals receiving 500 mg/kg SBI also tended to lose less bodyweight than animals treated only with irinotecan (P > 0.10). SBI-gavaged animals had less pronounced irinotecan-induced changes in neutrophil (P = 0.04959) and lymphocyte (P = 0.0035) levels, and lower tissue damage scores than those receiving irinotecan alone (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Twice daily oral gavage of SBI was well-tolerated and reduced the incidence, severity and duration of irinotecan-induced mucositis. SBI was associated with less pronounced changes in inflammatory cell levels and tissue damage to colon and jejunum. Ongoing experiments aim to investigate the mechanisms of SBI-associated gastrointestinal protection. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Abnormal gut barrier function is the basis of gut inflammatory disease. It is known that house dust mite (HDM) aero-allergens induce inflammation in respiratory mucosa. We have recently reported allergen from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p1) to be present in rodent gut. Objective: To examine whether der p1 is present in human gut and to assess its effect on gut barrier function and inflammation. Design: Colonic biopsies, gut fluid, serum and stool were collected from healthy adults during endoscopy. der p1 was measured by ELISA. Effect of HDM was assessed on gut permeability, tight-junction and mucin expression, and cytokine production, in presence or absence of cysteine protease inhibitors or serine protease inhibitors. In vivo effect of HDM was examined in mice given oral HDM or protease-neutralised HDM. Role of HDM in low-grade inflammation was studied in patients with IBS. Results: HDM der p1 was detected in the human gut. In colonic biopsies from healthy patients, HDM increased epithelial permeability (p<0.001), reduced expression of tight-junction proteins and mucus barrier. These effects were associated with increased tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-10 production and were abolished by cysteine-protease inhibitor (p<0.01). HDM effects did not require Th2 immunity. Results were confirmed in vivo in mice. In patients with IBS, HDM further deteriorated gut barrier function, induced TNF-α but failed to induce IL-10 secretion (p<0.001). Conclusions: HDM, a ubiquitous environmental factor, is present in the human gut where it directly affects gut function through its proteolytic activity. HDM may be an important trigger of gut dysfunction and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Increasing evidence indicates a strong link between intestinal health and bone health. For example, inflammatory bowel disease can cause systemic inflammation, weight loss, and extra-intestinal manifestations, such as decreased bone growth and density. However, the effects of moderate intestinal inflammation without weight loss on bone health have never been directly examined; yet this condition is relevant not only to IBD but to conditions of increased intestinal permeability and inflammation, as seen with ingestion of high-fat diets, intestinal dysbiosis, irritable bowel syndrome, metabolic syndrome, and food allergies. Here, we induced moderate intestinal inflammation without weight loss in young male mice by treating with a low dose of dextran sodium sulfate (1%) for 15 days. The mice displayed systemic changes marked by significant bone loss and a redistribution of fat from subcutaneous to visceral fat pad stores. Bone loss was caused by reduced osteoblast activity, characterized by decreased expression of osteoblast markers (runx2, osteocalcin), histomorphometry, and dynamic measures of bone formation. In addition, we observed a reduction in growth plate thickness and hypertrophic chondrocyte matrix components (collagen X). Correlation analyses indicate a link between gut inflammation and disease score, but more importantly, we observed that bone density measures negatively correlated with intestinal disease score, as well as colon and bone TNF-α levels. These studies demonstrate that colitis-induced bone loss is not dependent upon weight loss and support a role for inflammation in the link between gut and bone health, an important area for future therapeutic development. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - The modern clinical research on prostatitis started with the work of Stamey and coworkers who developed the basic principles we are still using. They established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main categories of prostatitis. Such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIH-NIDDK classification based on the use of the microbiological 4-glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide. The UPOINT system identifies groups of clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. The UPOINTS algorithm implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social (P), organ-specific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyper-echoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and mul-tidrug-resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other "genital mycoplasmas" is still a much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. “Next generation” investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gram-negative pathogens. The antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alpha-blockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of the microbiota is called “dysbiosis” causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (leaky gut syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment. © 2018 Edizioni Scripta Manent s.n.c. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Aim: A retrospective and prospective analysis of 63 outpatient cards of patients with organic (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and intestinal polyposis) and functional (irritable bowel syndrome) lesions of the gastrointestinal tract was performed. Method: The basis for the selection of patients with gastroenterological pathology has been the mechanisms of the development of diarrhea. All patients underwent microbiological analysis of feces for dysbacteriosis. Results: The carried out researches allowed to conclude that the shifts in the intestinal microbiocenosis of the examined patients toward reducing obligatory flora and the activation of opportunistic pathogens, combined with genetically determined biological changes, lead to an increase in intestinal permeability and, as a consequence, the development of clinical manifestations of the disease. Conclusion: Thus, the analysis of our own studies of patients with organic and functional intestinal lesions as well as the results of various research groups indicates that a change in the intestinal microbiocenosis in the direction of declining obligatory flora and activation of opportunistic microorganisms, combined with genetically determined biological changes, leads to an increase in intestinal permeability and, as a consequence, the development of clinical manifestations of the disease with the development of dysbiotic shifts. © 2017 American Physical Society.

AB  - Zonulin is considered a biomarker of increased intestinal permeability, and elevated levels have been found in celiac disease. The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between serum zonulin levels and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and secondarily, between zonulin levels and anthropometric and metabolic factors. The offspring (n = 363) of the participants of the Malmö Diet and Cancer cardiovascular cohort (MDC-CV) were invited to an anthropometric and clinical examination, where fasting plasma glucose levels were measured. Questionnaires about lifestyle factors and medical history were completed along with the Visual Analog Scale for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (VAS-IBS). Zonulin levels were measured in serum by ELISA. Neither GI symptoms nor GI diseases had any influence on zonulin levels. Higher zonulin levels were associated with higher waist circumference (p = 0.003), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.003), and glucose levels (p = 0.036). Higher zonulin levels were associated with increased risk of overweight (p < 0.001), obesity (p = 0.047), and hyperlipidemia (p = 0.048). We cannot detect altered zonulin levels among individuals reporting GI symptoms or GI diseases, but higher zonulin levels are associated with higher waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and increased risk of metabolic diseases. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Background: To determine the effect of Shuganyin decoction (SGD) on the intestinal barrier function in an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rat model induced by water-avoidance stress. Methods: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into control, water-avoidance stress (WAS) group, WAS plus Shuganyin decoction (SGD) group and WAS plus dicetel (Dicetel) group. IBS was induced in rats by subjecting them to water-avoidance stress for 7 days. On day 4 of the WAS protocol, the rats were treated for 7 consecutive days (days 4-11) with SGD, dicetel or a negative control (saline). The number of feces granules, histopathological changes of the intestine and mast cell (MC) morphometry were determined. Intestinal permeability was approximated by measuring the absorption of FITC-dextran 4400 (FD-4) from the lumen into the bloodstream in vivo and in vitro experiments. Also, the expression of protease active receptor-2 (PAR-2) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was estimated using immunohistochemical staining and ELISA, respectively. Tight junction (TJ) protein abundance was measured following a quantitative immunofluorescent analysis of intestinal sections and western blotting. Results: In vivo, WAS elicited a significantly increase in the transfer of FD-4 from the intestine to blood about threefold in 30 min compared with control group. After treated with SGD, the intestinal permeability to FD-4 of WAS-induced rats was significantly attenuated (P < 0.05). In vitro, the permeability coefficient (Papp) values were measured for FD-4 absorption across the excised intestine. WAS was shown to increase the intestinal permeability to (4.695 ± 0.3629) × 10-7 cm/s in 120 min, which was 2.6-fold higher than the control group. Rats treated with SGD showed a significant decrease in Papp values of FD-4 as compared to WAS group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, by immunofluorescent detection we found that WAS elicited the irregular distribution of TJ proteins. Using the quantitative analysis software of the medical image, the average optical density and protein abundance of TJ proteins was shown to be lower in the WAS group as compared to control group, (P < 0.05). SGD could attenuate this response and improve TJ distribution (P < 0.05). Western blot analysis confirmed that TJ protein abundance was significantly decreased in WAS group and that they could be returned to control levels following an SGD treatment. WAS also induced an increase in number of MCs, their area and diameter as compared to controls. These observations were attenuated with an SGD or dicetel treatment. Similarly, the expression of PAR-2 and TNF-α exceeded control values in the WAS group and were shown to be successfully attenuated with an SGD treatment. Conclusion: WAS-induced IBS rat model exhibited intestinal barrier dysfunction, which was manifested as tight junction damage and structural rearrangements that increased the intestinal permeability. Under these conditions, MCs were activated and degranulated in the intestinal mucosa leading to the activation of PAR-2. Our data showed that SGD could inhibit the activation of MCs and down-regulate the expression of both PAR-2 and TNF-α. In turn, this was shown to improve the expression and structural arrangement of TJ proteins in the intestinal mucosa, thereby regulating the intestinal permeability. It was concluded that Shuganyin could protect the intestinal barrier. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Implementation of gluten-free diets among nonceliac athletes has rapidly increased in recent years because of perceived ergogenic and health benefits. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on exercise performance, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, perceived well-being, intestinal injury, and inflammatory responses in nonceliac athletes. Methods: Thirteen competitive endurance cyclists (8 males, 5 females) with no positive clinical screening for celiac disease or history of irritable bowel syndrome (mean ± SD; age, 32 ± 7 yr; weight, 71.1 ± 13.4 kg; height, 177.0 ± 11.8 cm, VO2max 59.1 ± 8.0 mL·kg-1·min-1) were allocated to a 7-d gluten-containing diet (GCD) or GFD separated by a 10-d washout in a controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Cyclists ate a GFD alongside either gluten-containing or gluten-free food bars (16 g wheat gluten per day) while habitual training and nutrition behaviors were controlled. During each diet, cyclists completed the Daily Analysis of Life Demand for Athletes (DALDA) and GI questionnaires (postexercise and daily). On day 7, cyclists completed a submaximal steady-state (SS) 45-min ride at 70% Wmax followed by a 15-min time trial (TT). Blood samples were taken preexercise, post-SS, and post-TT to determine intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and inflammatory markers (cytokine responses: interleukin [IL] 1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor α). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to analyze data. Results: TT performance was not significantly different (P = 0.37) between the GCD (245.4 ± 53.4 kJ) and GFD (245.0 ± 54.6 kJ). GI symptoms during exercise, daily, and DALDA responses were similar for each diet (P > 0.11). There were no significant differences in IFABP (P = 0.69) or cytokine (P > 0.13) responses. Conclusions: A short-term GFD had no overall effect on performance, GI symptoms, well-being, and a select indicator of intestinal injury or inflammatory markers in nonceliac endurance athletes. © 2015 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

AB  - Background/Aims Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort accompanied by abnormal bowel movements. In sensitized subjects, ingested nickel (Ni) may induce gastrointestinal symptoms similar to IBS, in addition to typical systemic cutaneous lesions (systemic nickel allergy syndrome [SNAS]). A low nickel diet could improve the systemic manifestations. We evaluated prevalence of nickel allergy in IBS and effects of low Ni diet on (1) gastrointestinal symptoms control, (2) intestinal barrier function, (3) quality of life, and (4) psychological status of patients with IBS and Ni-sensitized patients. Methods Twenty consecutive patients affected by IBS and suspected SNAS underwent intestinal permeability tests. Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated using the visual analogue scale before and after 3 months low Ni diet. Subjects with increased intestinal permeability at baseline repeated nuclear examination after the diet. Results The most frequent profile was diarrhea-predominant IBS (8/20). The low Ni diet induced a significant and constant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and an equally significant improvement of visual analogue scale. Mean urinary output of 51Chromium ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetate (51Cr-EDTA) was 5.91%/24 hr (± 2.08), significantly different from the control group (2.20%/24 hr ± 0.60, P < 0.0001). Conclusion This pilot study shows that low Ni diet improves gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS and SNAS. © 2017 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

AB  - Background: Neural-immune-endocrine network mechanism has attracted increased attention in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Pre-clinical evidence indicates that nerve growth factor (NGF) mediates visceral hypersensitivity and gut barrier dysfunction, via interactions with mast cells and sensory nerve fibres. Aim: To explore the role of nerve growth factor, as well as mast cell–nerve growth factor–nerve interaction in IBS-D pathophysiology. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, IBS-D patients and healthy controls first underwent clinical and psychological assessments. Visceral sensitivity to rectal distension was tested. As gut barrier function markers, serum diamine oxidase and d-lactate were detected. Rectosigmoid biopsies were taken for the analyses of nerve growth factor expression, mast cell count and activation, and sensory nerve fibres expressing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Correlations between these parameters were examined in patients. Results: Thirty-eight IBS-D patients (28 males, 10 females; average age 30.2 years) and 20 healthy controls (12 males, 8 females; average age 26.8 years) participated in the study. The patients presented increased psychological symptoms, visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier function. NGF gene expression, mast cell count and sensory nerve fibres were significantly increased in the patients (P < 0.05). In correlation analysis, NGF expression was positively correlated with the disease severity, anxiety and serum diamine oxidase; visceral sensitivity thresholds were negatively associated with NGF expression (Bonferroni corrected P < 0.0029). Conclusions: Elevated mucosal NGF may interact with mast cells and sensory nerve fibres, contributing to visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier function in IBS-D. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier with minor inflammation are considered to play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Since pioglitazone is known to have anti-inflammatory property, we hypothesized that pioglitazone is beneficial for treating IBS. In this study, the effect was tested in rat IBS models such as lipopolysaccharide or repeated water avoidance stress-induced visceral allodynia and increased colonic permeability. Pioglitazone blocked these visceral changes, and GW9662, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) antagonist fully reversed the effect by pioglitazone. These results suggest that PPAR-γ activation by pioglitazone may be useful for IBS treatment. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Physical and psychological stress have been shown to modulate multiple aspects of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology, but its molecular basis remains elusive. We therefore characterized the stress-induced metabolic phenotype (metabotype) in soldiers during high-intensity combat training and correlated the metabotype with changes in GI symptoms and permeability. In a prospective, longitudinal study, urinary metabotyping was conducted on 38 male healthy soldiers during combat training and a rest period using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The urinary metabotype during combat training was clearly distinct from the rest period (partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) Q2 = 0.581), confirming the presence of a unique stress-induced metabotype. Differential metabolites related to combat stress were further uncovered, including elevated pyroglutamate and fructose, and reduced gut microbial metabolites, namely, hippurate and m-hydroxyphenylacetate (p < 0.05). The extent of pyroglutamate upregulation exhibited a positive correlation with an increase in IBS-SSS in soldiers during combat training (r = 0.5, p < 0.05). Additionally, the rise in fructose levels was positively correlated with an increase in intestinal permeability (r = 0.6, p < 0.005). In summary, protracted and mixed psychological and physical combat-training stress yielded unique metabolic changes that corresponded with the incidence and severity of GI symptoms and alteration in intestinal permeability. Our study provided novel molecular insights into stress-induced GI perturbations, which could be exploited for future biomarker research or development of therapeutic strategies. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background/Aims: Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a chronic, functional bowel disorder characterized by abdominal pain or diarrhoea and altered bowel habits, which correlate with intestinal hyperpermeability. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in regulating intestinal permeability in IBS-D. However, the role of miRNAs in regulating intestinal permeability and protecting the epithelial barrier remains unclear. Our goals were to (i) identify differential expression of miRNAs and their targets in the distal colon of IBS-D rats; (ii) verify in vitro whether occludin (OCLN) and zonula occludens 1 (ZO1/TJP1) were direct targets of miR-144 and were down-regulated in IBS-D rats; and (iii) determine whether down-regulation of miR-144 in vitro could reverse the pathological hallmarks of intestinal hyperpermeability via targeting OCLN and ZO1. Methods: The IBS-D rat model was established using 4% acetic acid and evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The distal colon was obtained in order to perform miRNA microarray analysis and to isolate and culture colonic epithelial cells. When differential expression of miRNA was found, the results were verified by qRT-PCR, and the target genes were further explored by bioinformatics analysis. Correlation analyses were carried out to compare the expression of miRNA and target genes. Then, mutants, miRNA mimics and inhibitors of the target genes were constructed and transfected to colonic epithelial cells. qRT-PCR, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and dual-luciferase assays were used to investigate the expression of miR-144 and OCLN, ZO1 in IBS-D rats. Results: There were 8 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated miRNAs identified in the IBS-D rat model. Of these, miR-144 was markedly up-regulated and resulted in the down-regulation of OCLN and ZO1 expression. Overexpression of miR-144 by transfection of miR-144 precursor markedly inhibited the expression of OCLN and ZO1. Further studies confirmed that OCLN and ZO1 were direct targets of miR-144. Additionally, intestinal hyperpermeability was enhanced by miR-144 up-regulation and attenuated by miR-144 down-regulation in IBS-D rat colonic epithelial cells. Moreover, rescue experiments showed that overexpression of OCLN and ZO1 significantly eliminated the inhibitory effect of miR-144, which showed a stronger effect on the attenuation of intestinal hyperpermeability. Conclusion: Up-regulation of miR-144 could promote intestinal hyperpermeability and impair the protective effect of the epithelial barrier by directly targeting OCLN and ZO1. miR-144 is likely a key regulator of intestinal hyperpermeability and could be a potential therapeutic target for IBS-D. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Key points: Reducing intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) dysfunctions is recognized as being of major therapeutic interest for various intestinal disorders. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is known to reduce IEB permeability. Here, we report in a pig model that SNS enhances morphological and functional recovery of IEB following mucosal injury induced via 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. These effects are associated with an increased expression of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and FAK. These results establish that SNS enhances intestinal barrier repair in acute mucosal injury. They further set the scientific basis for future use of SNS as a complementary or alternative therapeutic option for the treatment of gut disorders with IEB dysfunctions such as inflammatory bowel diseases or irritable bowel syndrome. Abstract: Intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) dysfunctions, such as increased permeability or altered healing, are central to intestinal disorders. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is known to reduce IEB permeability, but its ability to modulate IEB repair remains unknown. This study aimed to characterize the impact of SNS on mucosal repair following 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced lesions. Six pigs were stimulated by SNS 3 h prior to and 3 h after TNBS enema, while sham animals (n = 8) were not stimulated. The impact of SNS on mucosal changes was evaluated by combining in vivo imaging, histological and functional methods. Biochemical and transcriptomic approaches were used to analyse the IEB and mucosal inflammatory response. We observed that SNS enhanced the recovery from TNBS-induced increase in transcellular permeability. At 24 h, TNBS-induced alterations of mucosal morphology were significantly less in SNS compared with sham animals. SNS reduced TNBS-induced changes in ZO-1 expression and its epithelial pericellular distribution, and also increased pFAK/FAK expression compared with sham. Interestingly, SNS increased the mucosal density of neutrophils, which was correlated with an increase in trypsin and TGF-β1 levels compared with sham. Finally, SNS prevented the TNBS-induced increases in IL-1β and IL-4 over time that were observed with sham treatment. In conclusion, our results show that SNS enhances mucosal repair following injury. This study highlights novel mechanisms of action of SNS and identifies SNS as a new therapy for diseases with IEB repair disorders. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Intestinal inflammation has been implicated in a number of diseases, including diabetes, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. Important components of inflammation are interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which are elevated both on the luminal and submucosal sides of the intestinal epithelial barrier in several diseases. Here, we developed a novel Escherichia coli based detection system for IFN-γ and TNF-α comprised of a chimeric protein and a simple signal transduction construct, which could be deployed on the luminal side of the intestine. OmpA of E. coli was engineered to detect IFN-γ or TNF-α through the replacement of extracellular loops with peptide fragments from OprF of P. aeruginosa. OmpA/OprF chimeras were developed, capable of binding IFN-γ or TNF-α. The specific peptide fragments that bind IFN-γ were identified. IFN-γ or TNF-α binding the OmpA/OprF chimera induced the pspA promoter, driving β-galactosidase production. The OmpA/OprF chimera had a detection limit of 300pM for IFN-γ and 150pM for TNF-α. This work will further the development of bacteria based therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the gut. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Intestinal epithelial barrier function is impaired in irritable bowel syndrome patients. Claudins are highly expressed in cells with tight junctions and are involved in the intestinal epithelial barrier function. The expression pattern of tight junction proteins in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome have not been fully elucidated. We therefore recruited 17 diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients and 20 healthy controls. The expression of the tight junction-related proteins was examined in the ileal, cecal, and rectal mucosa of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients using real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. Claudin-2 expression was high in the ileum of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients. Claudin-2 expression was the same in cecum and rectal mucosa of control and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients. Similarly, the expression of clauidn-1, claudin-7, JAM-A, occludin, and ZO-1 in the ileal, cecal, and rectal mucosa did not change between control and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome samples. Infiltration of eosinophil and mast cells in the mucosa of ileum, cecum and rectum was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining and was not affected by diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Claudin-2 was expressed on the apical side of villi and crypts of ileal mucosal epithelial cells. Clauidn-2 expression is upregulated in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients and may contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. © 2017 JCBN.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) are poorly understood, but increased intestinal permeability is thought to contribute to symptoms. A recent clinical trial of gluten-free diet (GFD) demonstrated symptomatic improvement, relative to gluten-containing diet (GCD), which was associated with reduced intestinal permeability in non-celiac disease IBS-D patients. The aim of this study was to characterize intestinal epithelial tight junction composition in IBS-D before and after dietary gluten challenge. Biopsies from 27 IBS-D patients (13 GFD and 14 GCD) were examined by H&E staining and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC), MLC kinase, claudin-2, claudin-8 and claudin-15. Diet-induced changes were assessed and correlated with urinary mannitol excretion (after oral administration). In the small intestine, epithelial MLC phosphorylation was increased or decreased by GCD or GFD, respectively, and this correlated with increased intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Colonocyte expression of the paracellular Na + channel claudin-15 was also markedly augmented following GCD challenge (P<0.05). Conversely, colonic claudin-2 expression correlated with reduced intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Claudin-8 expression was not affected by dietary challenge. These data show that alterations in MLC phosphorylation and claudin-15 and claudin-2 expression are associated with gluten-induced symptomatology and intestinal permeability changes in IBS-D. The results provide new insight into IBS-D mechanisms and can explain permeability responses to gluten challenge in these patients. © 2017 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI), an oral nutritional therapy, is efficacious in diverse diarrheal diseases. In an open-label study in 15 patients with irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea (IBS-D), we evaluated effects of SBI (5.0 g, twice a day) for 8 weeks on safety, on bowel function and abdominal pain, tryptophan metabolism (K:T ratio), intestinal permeability (13C-mannitol and lactulose excretion), bile acid synthesis (fasting serum FGF-19 and C4), duodenal and stool microbiome, and the expression of 90 genes related to inflammation, immune function, and tight junctions in duodenal mucosa. Statistical analysis (paired tests, baseline vs. treatment) was based on intention to treat (ITT) principles. One of 15 Caucasian patients (13F, 2M, age 40.3 ± 2.3y, BMI 34.3 ± 3.0 kg/m2) withdrew without completing studies. There were improvements in stools/day (decrease, P < 0.001), ease of passage (P = 0.035), and evacuation (P = 0.004) with SBI therapy. Worst pain severity was numerically reduced in last 2 weeks' treatment (P = 0.078). Duodenal mucosal mRNA expression; serum C4, FGF-19, and KT ratio; small bowel or colon permeability; and stool microbiome were not significantly different after SBI therapy, compared to baseline. In duodenal brushings, there was considerable microbiota structure difference (β diversity analysis P = 0.072, UniFrac) and, on taxonomic analysis, increased abundance of Proteobacteria Burkholderiales, Firmicutes Catonella, and unclassified genus organisms with SBI therapy. Thus, SBI therapy for 8 weeks in IBS-D patients is associated with improved bowel function; the mechanism of benefit is unclear, though there were microbiota structure differences in duodenal brushings. Further studies in patients with low-grade inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction at baseline are indicated. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Mast cells are constitutively found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The three major physiological functions of GI mast cells comprise of - as far as we know - regulation of GI functions, namely epithelial and endothelial functions, crosstalk with the enteric nervous system, and contribution to the host defense against bacterial, viral and parasitic agents. A number of chronic GI diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergies, are thought to be associated with mast cell hyperplasia and humoral activity. Clinical conditions characterized by a decrease in mast cell functionality are not known so far. In the present review, we summarize current evidence which show that human mast cells play a central role at the GI barrier, both in health and disease. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The role of low-grade inflammation in the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) has attracted increasing attention. Abnormal CD11c+ mononuclear phagocytes, such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and monocytes, are involved in the disruption of immune tolerance in organisms, which can lead to the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. The present study tested the hypothesis that CD11c+ lamina propria mononuclear phagocytes (CD11c+ LPMPs) contribute to increased mucosal permeability and visceral hypersensitivity in a PI-IBS mouse model. CD11c+ LPMPs were isolated and purified via the digestion of intestinal tissues and magnetic-activated cell sorting. We detected increased mucosal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal inflammation during both the acute and chronic stages of Trichinella infection. Following the transfer of CD11c+ LPMPs from PI-IBS mice into normal mice, low-grade inflammation was detected, as demonstrated by increased IL-4 expression in the ileum, as well as enhanced mucosal permeability, as indicated by decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and the presence of ultrastructural alterations. More importantly, the mice that underwent adoptive transfer of CD11c+ LPMPs from the PI-IBS mice also exhibited increased abdominal withdrawal reflex scores and a decreased threshold. Our data demonstrated that the CD11c+ LPMPs from this PI-IBS mouse model were not only able to transfer enteric inflammation to the normal mice but also caused abnormal intestinal function, characterized by epithelial barrier disruption and visceral hyperalgesia.

AB  - Foods high in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) exacerbate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, their mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesized that a high-FODMAP (HFM) diet increases visceral nociception by inducing dysbiosis and that the FODMAP-altered gut microbial community leads to intestinal pathology. We fed rats an HFM and showed that HFM increases rat fecal Gram-negative bacteria, elevates lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and induces intestinal pathology, as indicated by inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and visceral hypersensitivity (VH). These manifestations were prevented by antibiotics and reversed by low-FODMAP (LFM) diet. Additionally, intracolonic administration of LPS or fecal supernatant (FS) from HFM-fed rats caused intestinal barrier dysfunction and VH, which were blocked by the LPS antagonist LPS-RS or by TLR4 knockdown. Fecal LPS was higher in IBS patients than in healthy subjects (HS), and IBS patients on a 4-week LFM diet had improved IBS symptoms and reduced fecal LPS levels. Intracolonic administration of FS from IBS patients, but not FS from HS or LFM-treated IBS patients, induced VH in rats, which was ameliorated by LPS-RS. Our findings indicate that HFM-associated gut dysbiosis and elevated fecal LPS levels induce intestinal pathology, thereby modulating visceral nociception and IBS symptomatology, and might provide an explanation for the success of LFM diet in IBS patients.

AB  - Background/Aims Abnormal immune regulation and increased intestinal permeability augmenting the passage of bacterial molecules that can activate immune cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, have been reported in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim was to compare the maturation phenotype of monocytes/macrophages (CD14+) from IBS patients and controls in the presence or absence of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS), in vitro. Methods Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood of 20 Rome II-IBS patients and 19 controls and cultured with or without LPS for 72 hours. The maturation phenotype was examined by flow cytometry as follows: M1-Early (CD11c+CD206-), M2-Advanced (CD11c-CD206+CX3CR1+); expression of membrane markers was reported as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). The Mann-Whitney test was used and significance was set at P < 0.05. Results In CD14+ cells, CD11c expression decreased with vs without LPS both in IBS (MFI: 8766.0 ± 730.2 vs 12 920.0 ± 949.2, P < 0.001) and controls (8233.0 ± 613.9 vs 13 750.0 ± 743.3, P < 0.001). M1-Early cells without LPS, showed lower CD11c expression in IBS than controls (MFI: 11 540.0 ± 537.5 vs 13 860.0 ± 893.7, P = 0.040), while both groups showed less CD11c in response to LPS (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the percentage of "Intermediate" (CD11c+CD206+CX3CR1+) cells without LPS, was higher in IBS than controls (IBS = 9.5 ± 1.5% vs C = 4.9 ± 1.4%, P < 0.001). Finally, fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) expression on M2-Advanced cells was increased when treated with LPS in controls but not in IBS (P < 0.001). Conclusions The initial phase of monocyte/macrophage maturation appears to be more advanced in IBS compared to controls. However, the decreased CX3CR1 in patients with IBS, compared to controls, when stimulated with LPS suggests a state of immune activation in IBS. © 2017 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional, gastrointestinal disease characterized by a combination of chronic or recurrent symptoms such as abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habit. Most of the IBS features occur without identifiable organic cause and are strongly influenced by stress and anxiety suggesting the involvement of brain–gut interactions in this disease. Microbiota changes have also been reported such as decreased abundance of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and increased firmicutes: bacteroidetes ratio but there is no consensus on a specific IBS microbiota signature. Psychological stress in rodents impacts intestinal epithelial barrier integrity as well as the composition of microbial communities and induces visceral pain, providing an interesting model for IBS pathophysiology investigation. Modulation of the intestinal microbiota using probiotics in preclinical trials prevents stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity directly through probiotic metabolites production or indirectly through prevention of the intestinal barrier function impairment. The clinical efficacy of probiotic treatments has also been suggested but the use of different scales to analyze the mean differences of symptoms in various studies has limited the ability of all existing meta-analyses in IBS to confirm the effectiveness of probiotics on major IBS symptoms and patient quality of life. © Lavoisier SAS 2018

AB  - Background: Alterations in intestinal permeability regulated by tight junctions (TJs) are associated with immune activation and visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is an important mediator of epithelial TJ. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of MLCK in the pathogenesis of IBS using a post infectious IBS (PI-IBS) mouse model. Methods: Trichinella spiralis-infected PI-IBS mouse model was used. Urine lactulose/mannitol ratio was measured to assess intestinal epithelial permeability. Western blotting was used to evaluate intestinal TJ protein (zonula occludens-1) and MLCK-associated protein expressions. Immune profile was assessed by measuring Th (T helper) 1/Th2 cytokine expression. Visceral sensitivity was determined by abdominal withdrawal reflex in response to colorectal distension. Results: Eight weeks after inoculation with T. spiralis, PI-IBS mice developed decreased pain and volume thresholds during colorectal distention, increased urine lactulose/mannitol ratio, elevated colonic Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio, and decreased zonula occludens-1 expression compared to the control mice. MLCK expression was dramatically elevated in the colonic mucosa of PI-IBS mice compared to the control mice, alongside increased pMLC/MLC and decreased MLCP expression. Administration of MLCK inhibitor and TJ blocker both reversed the increased intestinal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity, and Th1-dominant immune profile in PI-IBS mice. Conclusion: MLCK is a pivotal step in inducing increased intestinal permeability promoting low-grade intestinal immune activation and visceral hypersensitivity in PI-IBS mice. MLCK inhibitor may provide a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of IBS. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder characterized by abdominal pain and abnormalities in defecation associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety due to the dysfunction of brain-gut axis. This study aims to determine whether trans-Resveratrol affects chronic-acute combined stress (CACS)-induced IBS-like symptoms including depression, anxiety and intestinal dysfunction. Methods: ICR male mice were exposed to the CACS for 3 weeks. trans-Resveratrol were administrated daily (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.g.) 30 min before CACS. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate the treatment effects of trans-Resveratrol on IBS. Hippocampus tissues were collected and processed Golgi staining and immuno-blot analysis. Ileum and colon tissues were collected and processed Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and immuno-blot analysis. Results: Administration with trans-Resveratrol before CACS for 3 weeks significantly reversed CACS-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors and intestinal dysfunction in mice, which implied a crucial role of trans-Resveratrol in treatment of IBS-like disorder. Furthermore, trans-Resveratrol improved hippocampal neuronal remodeling, protected ileal and colonic epithelial barrier structure against CACS insults. The further study suggested that trans-Resveratrol normalized phosphodiesterases 4A (PDE4A) expression and CREB-BDNF signaling that were disturbed by CACS. The increased pCREB and BDNF expression in the hippocampus were found, while decreased pCREB and BDNF levels were observed after treatment with trans-Resveratrol. Conclusions: The dual effects of trans-Resveratrol on stress-induced psychiatric and intestinal dysfunction may be related to normalization of PDE4A expression and subsequent pCREB-BDNF signaling in the hippocampus, ileum and colon. © 2018 Xu, Cui, Ma, Shi, Yu, Li, Zheng, Zhang, Si and Yu.

AB  - Background: Ghrelin levels and obestatin/ghrelin ratio have been proposed as activity markers in ulcerative colitis, but no data are available in celiac disease (CD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our aims were as follows: (a) to assess obestatin and ghrelin concentrations in adult active CD patients, diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-d), and healthy controls (HC) in relation to intestinal permeability; (b) to evaluate the ghrelin-obestatin profile in CD patients after a 1-year gluten-free diet (GFD); and (c) to establish the impact of ghrelin genetics. Methods: The study included 31 CD patients, 28 IBS-d patients, and 19 HC. Intestinal permeability, assayed by highperformance liquid chromatography determination of urinary lactulose (La)/mannitol (Ma), and circulating concentrations of obestatin, ghrelin, and their ratio were evaluated at enrollment and after GFD. The ghrelin single nucleotide polymorphisms Arg51Gln (rs34911341), Leu72Met (rs696217), and Gln90Leu (rs4684677) were analyzed. Results: Intestinal permeability was impaired in CD patients and ameliorated after GFD. Ghrelin was significantly (P =0.048) higher and the obestatin/ghrelin ratio was significantly (P= 0.034) lower in CD patients compared with both IBS-d and HC, and GFD reduced the peptide levels, but without reaching the concentrations in HC. Significant differences (P< 0.05) were found in the Leu72Met polymorphism among groups, with the reduction of the GT genotype and the T allele in both CD and IBS-d patients compared with HC. Conclusion: Intestinal permeability is altered in CD, but not in IBS-d patients, and ghrelin levels increase in CD patients as observed in other inflammatory conditions. Moreover, a role for ghrelin genetics is hypothesized in sustaining the many pathogenetic components of these different pathologies, but with a similar symptom profile.

AB  - Although probiotics have been used for many years by those who suffer from what would now be defined as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a scientific rationale for their use in this indication and clinical evidence to support their benefits have only emerged very recently. Evidence to support considering strategies, such as probiotics, that modulate the gut microbiome, in IBS, has been provided by laboratory studies implicating the microbiome and the host response to the enteric microenvironment in IBS, as well as in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating the ability of various commensal bacteria to influence such relevant functions as motility, visceral sensation, gut barrier integrity, and brain-gut interactions. Clinical studies supporting a role for probiotics in the management of IBS predated such experimental data, and randomized controlled trials of probiotics in IBS continue to be reported. Their interpretation is hampered by the less than optimal quality of many studies; nevertheless, it is apparent that probiotics, as a category, do exert significant effects in IBS. Defining the optimal strain, dose, formulation, and duration of therapy is more challenging given the limitations of available data. There is also an urgent need for appropriately powered and rigorously designed clinical trials of appropriate duration of probiotics in IBS; such studies should also help to define those who are most likely to respond to probiotics. Future laboratory and translational research should attempt to define the mechanism(s) of action of probiotics in IBS and explore the response to bacterial components or products in this common and oftentimes troublesome disorder.

AB  - Objective Nuclear receptors are known to regulate both immune and barrier functions in the GI tract. The nuclear orphan receptor NR2F6 has been shown to suppress the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in T lymphocytes. NR2F6 gene expression is reduced in patients with IBS or UC, but its functional role and tissue dependency in healthy and inflamed gut have not yet been investigated. Design Intestinal inflammation was induced in wild-type, Nr2f6-deficient, Rag1-deficient or bone marrow-reconstituted mice by administration of chemical (dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)) and immunogenic (T cell transfer) triggers. Disease phenotypes were investigated by survival, body weight, colon length and analysis of immune cell infiltrates. Additionally, histology, intestinal permeability, tight junction proteins, bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridisation, apoptosis, cell proliferation and mucus production were investigated. Results Nr2f6-deficient mice were highly susceptible to DSS-induced colitis characterised by enhanced weight loss, increased colonic tissue destruction and immune cell infiltration together with enhanced intestinal permeability and reduced Muc2 expression. T cell transfer colitis and bone marrow reconstitution experiments demonstrated that disease susceptibility was not dependent on the expression of Nr2f6 in the immune compartment but on the protective role of NR2F6 in the intestinal epithelium. Mechanistically, we show that NR2F6 binds to a consensus sequence at -2 kb of the Muc2 promoter and transactivates Muc2 expression. Loss of NR2F6 alters intestinal permeability and results in spontaneous late-onset colitis in Nr2f6-deficient mice. Conclusion We have for the first time identified a fundamental and non-redundant role of NR2F6 in protecting gut barrier homeostasis. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB  - There is increasing concern in identifying the mechanisms underlying the intimate control of the intestinal barrier, as deregulation of its function is strongly associated with digestive (organic and functional) and a number of non-digestive (schizophrenia, diabetes, sepsis, among others) disorders. The intestinal barrier is a complex and effective defensive functional system that operates to limit luminal antigen access to the internal milieu while maintaining nutrient and electrolyte absorption. Intestinal permeability to substances is mainly determined by the physicochemical properties of the barrier, with the epithelium, mucosal immunity, and neural activity playing a major role. In functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), the absence of structural or biochemical abnormalities that explain chronic symptoms is probably close to its end, as recent research is providing evidence of structural gut alterations, at least in certain subsets, mainly in functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These alterations are associated with increased permeability, which seems to reflect mucosal inflammation and neural activation. The participation of each anatomical and functional component of barrier function in homeostasis and intestinal dysfunction is described, with a special focus on FGIDs. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - Previously we showed that urine trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) levels were higher in females with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) compared to non-IBS females. To assess if TFF3 is associated with symptoms and/or reflect alterations in gastrointestinal permeability and gut microbiota in an IBS population, we correlated stool and urine TFF3 levels with IBS symptoms, intestinal permeability, stool microbial diversity and relative abundance of predominant bacterial families and genera. We also tested the relationship of stool TFF3 to urine TFF3, and compared results based on hormone contraception use. Samples were obtained from 93 females meeting Rome III IBS criteria and completing 4-week symptom diaries. TFF3 levels were measured by ELISA. Permeability was assessed with the urine lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio. Stool microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA. Stool TFF3, but not urine TFF3, was associated positively with diarrhoea and loose stool consistency. Higher stool TFF3 was also associated with lower L/M ratio and microbial diversity. Of the 20 most abundant bacterial families Mogibacteriaceae and Christensenellaceae were inversely related to stool TFF3, with only Christensenellaceae remaining significant after multiple comparison adjustment. There were no significant relationships between stool or urine TFF3 levels and other symptoms, nor between stool and urine levels. In premenopausal females, urine TFF3 levels were higher in those reporting hormone contraception. Collectively these results suggest that higher stool TFF3 levels are associated with IBS symptoms (loose/diarrhoeal stools), lower gut permeability, and altered stool bacteria composition (decreased diversity and decreased Christensenellaceae), which further suggests that TFF3 may be an important marker of host-bacteria interaction. © 2018 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) system is responsible for the digestion and absorption of ingested food and liquids. Due to the complexity of the GI tract and the substantial volume of material that could be covered under the scope of GI physiology, this chapter briefly reviews the overall function of the GI tract, and discusses the major factors affecting GI physiology and function, including the intestinal microbiota, chronic stress, inflammation, and aging with a focus on the neural regulation of the GI tract and an emphasis on basic braingut interactions that serve to modulate the GI tract. GI diseases refer to diseases of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and rectum. The major symptoms of common GI disorders include recurrent abdominal pain and bloating, heartburn, indigestion/dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. GI disorders rank among the most prevalent disorders, with the most common including esophageal and swallowing disorders, gastric and peptic ulcer disease, gastroparesis or delayed gastric emptying, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many GI disorders are difficult to diagnose and their symptoms are not effectively managed. Thus, basic research is required to drive the development of novel therapeutics which are urgently needed. One approach is to enhance our understanding of gut physiology and pathophysiology especially as it relates to gut-brain communications since they have clinical relevance to a number of GI complaints and represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of conditions including inflammatory diseases of the GI tract such as IBD and functional gut disorders such as IBS. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - Blastocystis spp. are commonly reported intestinal protists but whose clinical significance remains controversial. Infections have ranged from asymptomatic carriage to non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms and have also been linked to irritable bowel syndrome and urticaria in some patient populations. In vitro studies showed that both parasite and parasite lysates have damaging effects on intestinal epithelial cells causing apoptosis and degradation of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO1, resulting in increased intestinal permeability. Adhesion of trophic forms to the intestinal epithelium and release of cysteine proteases appear to be the major triggers leading to pathogenesis. Two putative virulence factors identified are cysteine proteases legumain and cathepsin B. Blastocystis spp. also have immuno-modulatory effects including degradation of IgA, inhibition of iNOS and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, IL8 and GM-CSF in intestinal epithelial cells and IL1β, IL6 and TNFα in murine macrophages. Blastocystis spp. have also been reported to dampen response to LPS in intestinal epithelial cells and monocytes. Studies in rodent models and naturally infected pigs have shown that the parasite localizes to the lumen and mucosal surface of the large intestine mostly in the caecum and colon. The parasite has been found to cause mucosal sloughing, increase in goblet cell mucin, increased intestinal permeability and to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine response with upregulation of TNFα, IFNγ and IL12. In this review, we summarize findings from in vitro and in vivo studies that demonstrate pathogenic potential but also show considerable inter and intra subtype variation, which provides a plausible explanation on the conflicting reports on clinical significance. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can be comorbidities that are difficult to treat. In this patient, an evidenceinformed treatment pathway guided by laboratory biomarkers was used to address both conditions. Case Presentation: A 69-y-old female patient presented with a 50-y history of sinusitis that was worse in the winter, postnasal drip, frequent sore throats, gastrointestinal complaints, headaches, and yeast infections. Two sinus surgeries (in years 2000 and 2002) and multiple courses of antibiotics had not resolved her sinus symptoms. In addition to CRS and IBS, this patient was noted to have intestinal overgrowth of Candida albicans, multiple food sensitivities, and leaky gut syndrome. Conclusion: Antifungal medication and dietary changes in the course of 8 mo resulted in the resolution of her CRS and IBS.

AB  - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are related gastrointestinal disorders characterized by abdominal pain associated with colonic hypersensitivity (CHS). Studies in humans have reported an abnormal colonization of Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC) in the ileum of Crohn's disease (CD) patients associated with overexpression of the bacterial colonizing receptor CEACAM6. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether AIEC reference strain LF82 could induce intestinal impairment during infectious and/or post-infectious periods and subsequently the development of CHS. Transgenic mice overexpressing human CEACAM6 protein (TG) and their wild-type littermates were gavaged by CD-associated AIEC bacteria (reference strain LF82) or PBS for 3 d. Colonic hypersensitivity was assessed by colorectal distension (CRD) test during infectious (D4) and post-infectious periods (D21). Several markers of intestinal inflammation were monitored and the colonic expression of purinergic P2X receptors was quantified. At D4, an increased visceromotor response (VMR) to the CRD test was observed in TG mice infected with CD-associated AIEC LF82 in comparison with non-infected TG mice and persisted in a subgroup of infected animals at D21 after bacteria clearance. Increased VMR was associated with low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal permeability and expression of P2X 3, 4 and 7. This study shows that certain susceptible hosts infected with CD-associated AIEC bacteria can develop persistent CHS associated with low-grade inflammation and increased P2X receptors expression. Thus, CD-associated AIEC infection in CEACAM6 transgenic mice could be used as a novel post-infectious mouse model mimicking quiescent IBD with IBS-like symptoms such as visceral pain. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Microbial dysbiosis and prolonged immune activation resulting in low-grade inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction have been suggested to be underlying causes of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in cytokine response between mucosal specimens of PI-IBS patients and healthy controls (HC) after ex vivo stimulation with key anaerobic bacteria. Methods: Colonic biopsies from 11 PI-IBS patients and 10 HC were stimulated ex vivo with the commensal bacteria Bacteroides ovatus, Ruminococcus gnavus, Akkermansia muciniphila, Subdoligranulum variabile and Eubacterium limosum, respectively. The cytokine release (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-γ) in stimulation supernatants was analyzed using the LUMINEX assay. Comparison of cytokine release between PI-IBS patients and healthy controls was performed taking both unstimulated and bacterially stimulated mucosal specimens into account. Key Results: IL-13 release from mucosal specimens without bacterial stimulation was significantly lower in PI-IBS patients compared to HC (p < 0.05). After stimulation with Subdoligranulum variabile, IL-1β release from PI-IBS patients was significantly increased compared to HC (p < 0.05). Stimulation with Eubacterium limosum resulted in a significantly decreased IL-10 release in HC compared to PI-IBS patients (p < 0.05) and a tendency to decreased IL-13 release in HC compared to PI-IBS patients (p = 0.07). Conclusions & Inferences: PI-IBS patients differ from HC with regard to cytokine release ex vivo after stimulation with selected commensal bacteria. Hence, our results support that the pathogenesis of PI-IBS comprises an altered immune response against commensal gut microbes. © 2015 Sundin et al.

AB  - The present study aimed to explore the correlation between cytokine expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF.-α), interleukin (IL).-8 and IL.-10 with occludin production, abdominal symptoms and psychological factors in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.-associated diarrhea (IBS.-D). A total of 42 IBS.-D patients and 20 healthy controls were included, which were recruited from QiLu Hospital in China. ELISA and immunohistochemical analysis were performed for evaluating the cytokines (TNF.-α, IL.-8 and IL.-10) and occludin protein levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of all subjects. In addition, the abdominal symptoms and psychological status were assessed in IBS.-D patients. Levels of TNF.-α and IL.-8 in the PBMCs of patients with IBS.D were significantly higher than those in the controls (P<0.001 and P=0.007, respectively), while IL.-10 levels were significantly reduced in patients with IBS.-D (P=0.047). Occludin production was significantly reduced in patients with IBS.-D as compared with that in the controls (P<0.001). In patients with IBS.-D, levels of TNF.-α and IL.-8 were negatively correlated with occludin levels (r=0.34, P=0.028; r=0.52, P<0.001, respectively). IL.-10 showed a negative correlation with occludin production (r=0.05, P=0.748). Furthermore, TNF.-α, IL.8 and IL.10 levels were significantly correlated with symptoms scores (r=0.74, P<0.001; r=0.55, P<0.001; r=0.80, P<0.001, respectively) in patients with IBS.-D. Within the IBS.-D group, TNF.-α expression was significantly increased in patients with a self.rating depression scale (SDS) score.50 (P=0.004) as compared with that in patients with an SDS score <50. Furthermore, IL.8 was significantly increased in IBS.D patients with a self.-rating anxiety scale (SAS) or SDS score.50 (P=0.016, P=0.008, respectively) as compared with that in patients scoring <50. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that in IBS.-D, an imbalance of cytokine production evoked colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction, abdominal symptoms and psychological disorders.

AB  - Background and aims The barrier function of the small intestinal mucosa prevents the introduction of undesired pathogens into the body. Breakdown of this barrier function increases intestinal permeability. This has been proposed to induce not only gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, but also various other diseases, including allergies, diabetes mellitus, liver diseases, and collagen diseases, which are associated with this so called "leaky gut syndrome" As such, a method to prevent leaky gut syndrome would have substantial clinical value. However, no drugs have been demonstrated to improve disturbed intestinal permeability in humans to date. Therefore, we investigated whether a drug used to treat chronic constipation, lubiprostone, was effective for this purpose. Methods Healthy male volunteers were treated with lubiprostone (24 μg/day) for 28 days. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by measuring the lactulose-mannitol ratio (LMR) after administration of diclofenac and compared with an untreated group. The examination was conducted three times in total, i.e., at baseline before diclofenac administration and after 14 and 28 days of lubiprostone treatment. Blood endotoxin activity was also evaluated at the same time points. Results The final analysis was conducted on 28 subjects (14 in the lubiprostone group and 14 in the untreated group). The LMR after 28 days of treatment was significantly lower in the lubiprostone group than that in the untreated group (0.017 vs. 0.028, respectively; 95% confidence interval, -0.022-0.0001; p = 0.049). Blood endotoxin activity exhibited almost no change over time in the lubiprostone and untreated groups and displayed no significant differences at any time point of examination. Conclusions This study is the first to report an improvement in leaky gut using an available drug in humans. The result suggests that lubiprostone may prevent and ameliorate "leaky gut syndrome ". However, a pivotal trial is needed to confirm our finding. © 2017 Kato et al.

AB  - Functional and morphological alterations of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) have been consistently reported in digestive disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. There is mounting evidence that Parkinson's disease (PD) is not only a brain disease but also a digestive disorder. Gastrointestinal involvement is a frequent and early event in the course of PD, and it may be critically involved in the early development of the disease. We therefore undertook the present survey to investigate whether changes in the IEB function and/or morphology occur in PD. Colonic biopsies were performed in 31 PD patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls. The para- and transcellular permeability were evaluated by measuring sulfonic acid and horseradish peroxidase flux respectively, in colonic biopsies mounted in Ussing chambers. The expression and localization of the two tight junctions proteins ZO-1 and occludin were analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively. The para- and transcellular permeability were not different between PD patients and controls. The expression of occludin, but not ZO-1, was significantly lower in colonic samples from PD patients as compared to controls and the cellular distribution of both proteins was altered in colonic mucosal specimens from PD patients. Our findings provide evidence that the IEB is morphologically altered in PD and further reinforce the potential role of the gastrointestinal tract in the initiation and/or the progression of the disease.

AB  - Background & Aims Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis and symptoms of IBS develop following gastroenteritis. We aimed to study the passage of live bacteria through the colonic epithelium, and determine the role of mast cells (MCs) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in barrier regulation in IBS and healthy individuals. Methods Colon biopsies from 32 women with IBS and 15 age-matched healthy women (controls) were mounted in Ussing chambers; we measured numbers of fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli HS and Salmonella typhimurium that passed through from the mucosal side to the serosal side of the tissue. Some biopsies were exposed to agents that block the VIP receptors (VPAC1 and VPAC2) or MCs. Levels of VIP and tryptase were measured in plasma and biopsy lysates. Number of MCs and MCs that express VIP or VIP receptors were quantified by immunofluorescence. Biopsies from an additional 5 patients with IBS and 4 controls were mounted in chambers and Salmonella were added; we studied passage routes through the epithelium by transmission electron microscopy and expression of tight junctions by confocal microscopy. Results In colon biopsies from patients with IBS, larger numbers of E coli HS and S typhimurium passed through the epithelium than in biopsies from controls (P <.0005). In transmission electron microscopy analyses, bacteria were found to cross the epithelium via only the transcellular route. Bacterial passage was reduced in biopsies from patients with IBS and controls after addition of antibodies against VPACs or ketotifen, which inhibits MCs. Plasma samples from patients with IBS had higher levels of VIP than plasma samples from controls. Biopsies from patients with IBS had higher levels of tryptase, larger numbers of MCs, and a higher percentage of MCs that express VPAC1 than biopsies from controls. In biopsies from patients with IBS, addition of Salmonella significantly reduced levels of occludin; subsequent addition of ketotifen significantly reversed this effect. Conclusions We found that colonic epithelium tissues from patients with IBS have increased translocation of commensal and pathogenic live bacteria compared with controls. The mechanisms of increased translocation include MCs and VIP. © 2017 AGA Institute

AB  - The intestinal barrier dysfunction is a critical pathological change in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Prim-O-glucosylcimifugin (POG) on intestinal barrier dysfunction and reveal possible molecular mechanisms. Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) cell monolayers induced by tryptase (TRYP) were used to establish an intestinal barrier dysfunction model. Caco-2 cell monolayers from both functional and dysfunctional samples were treated with POG (30, 60 and 120µg/mL) for 2, 8, 24, 36, 48 and 72h. The Caco-2 cell monolayers were assessed by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and percentage of fluorescein permeation (PFP). The expression of Protease Activated Receptor 2 (PAR-2) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR and the level of Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) protein expression was determined by Western blot. In addition, the impact of POG on the distribution of the tight juction protein of Occludin was performed by immunofluorescence. Our results showed that POG elevated the TEER and decreased the PFP of the functional Caco-2 cell monolayers, as well as the dysfunctional Caco-2 cell monolayers. Furthermore, POG inhibited the expression of PAR-2 mRNA and MLCK mRNA and increased the level of ZO-1 protein expression in dysfunctional Caco-2 cells. The distribution of the Occludin proteins was ameliorated simultaneously. This study demonstrates that POG can enhance the intestinal barrier function of Caco-2 cell monolayers by inhibiting the expression of PAR-2 and MLCK and up-regulating the expression of ZO-1 protein, and ameliorated the distribution of Occludin protein. © 2018 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan

AB  - Background: Evidence has implicated the translocation of commensal Gram-negative bacteria (Gram-B) due to leaky gut in the pathophysiology of depression and physio-somatic symptoms (e.g. fatigue, pain, irritable bowel syndrome, malaise, etc.). In addition, the leaky gut may contribute to immune-inflammatory activation and oxidative stress. This study investigated whether bacterial translocation is associated with perinatal depression and anxiety scores and with prenatal physio-somatic symptoms and immune-inflammatory biomarkers, including the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway. Method: Data were collected in pregnant women at the end of term (T1) and 4-6 weeks after delivery (T2) as well as in non-pregnant controls. We examined the associations between serum IgM/IgA responses to Gram-B at the end of term and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale -EPDS) and anxiety (Spielberger’s State Anxiety Inventory -STAI) symptoms. Results: Levels of C-reactive protein, zinc, haptoglobin, hematocrit and IgA/IgM responses to 9 TRY-CATs were also measured. No significant associations of the IgA/IgM responses to Gram-B with prenatal depression and anxiety were observed. Increased IgA/IgM responses to Gram-B predict higher levels of haptoglobin, hematocrit and TRYCATs, in particular quinolinic acid and the quinolinic acid/kynurenic acid ratio. IgA responses to Gram-B were significantly lowered in pregnant women compared to age-matched non-pregnant women, while IgM responses were significantly elevated in participants with alcohol consumption. Physio-somatic symptoms at the end of term were significantly associated with IgM responses to Klebsiella pneumonia. Postnatal anxiety was significantly predicted by IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that pregnancy may protect against bacterial translocation, while alcohol use may increase bacterial translocation. The results suggest that end of term mucosa-derived immune responses to Gram-B contribute to immune activation, physio-somatic symptoms at the end of term and postnatal anxiety. Highlights: • Immune responses to Gram - Bacteria associate with physio-somatic symptoms in pregnancy. • IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa predict anxiety symptoms after delivery. • Pregnancy may have a protective effect against bacterial translocation. • Alcohol use increases leaky gut and bacterial translocation. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Background:Recent studies showed that patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) had an increased intestinal permeability as well as a decreased expression of tight junctions. Glutamine, the major substrate of rapidly dividing cells, is able to modulate intestinal permeability and tight junction expression in other diseases. We aimed to evaluate, ex vivo, glutamine effects on tight junction proteins, claudin-1 and occludin, in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS-D. Materials and Methods: Twelve patients with IBS-D, diagnosed with the Rome III criteria, were included (8 women/4 men, aged 40.7 ± 6.9 years). Colonic biopsy specimens were collected and immediately incubated for 18 hours in culture media with increasing concentrations of glutamine from 0.6-10 mmol/L. Claudin-1 and occludin expression was then measured by immunoblot, and concentrations of cytokines were assessed by multiplex technology. Claudin-1 expression was affected by glutamine (P <.05, analysis of variance). In particularly, 10 mmol/L glutamine increased claudin-1 expression compared with 0.6 mmol/L glutamine (0.47 ± 0.04 vs 0.33 ± 0.03, P <.05). In contrast, occludin expression was not significantly modified by glutamine. Interestingly, glutamine effect was negatively correlated to claudin-1 (Pearson r = -0.83, P <.001) or occludin basal expression (Pearson r = -0.84, P <.001), suggesting that glutamine had more marked effects when tight junction protein expression was altered. Cytokine concentrations in culture media were not modified by glutamine treatment. Conclusion: Glutamine increased claudin-1 expression in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS-D. In addition, glutamine effect seems to be dependent on basal expression of tight junction proteins. © 2015 The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.

AB  - A growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence supports a relationship between the complexity and diversity of the microorganisms that inhabit our gut (human gastrointestinal microbiota) and health status. Under normal homeostatic conditions this microbial population helps maintain intestinal peristalsis, mucosal integrity, pH balance, immune priming and protection against invading pathogens. Furthermore, these microbes can influence centrally regulated emotional behaviour through mechanisms including microbially derived bioactive molecules (amino acid metabolites, short-chain fatty acids, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters), mucosal immune and enteroendocrine cell activation, as well as vagal nerve stimulation. The microbiota-gut-brain axis comprises a dynamic matrix of tissues and organs including the brain, autonomic nervous system, glands, gut, immune cells and gastrointestinal microbiota that communicate in a complex multidirectional manner to maintain homeostasis and resist perturbation to the system. Changes to the microbial environment, as a consequence of illness, stress or injury, can lead to a broad spectrum of physiological and behavioural effects locally including a decrease in gut barrier integrity, altered gut motility, inflammatory mediator release as well as nociceptive and distension receptor sensitisation. Centrally mediated events including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neuroinflammatory events and neurotransmitter systems are concomitantly altered. Thus, both central and peripheral pathways associated with pain manifestation and perception are altered as a consequence of the microbiota-gut-brain axis imbalance. In this chapter the involvement of the gastrointestinal microbiota in visceral pain is reviewed. We focus on the anatomical and physiological nodes whereby microbiota may be mediating pain response, and address the potential for manipulating gastrointestinal microbiota as a therapeutic target for visceral pain. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - Adverse reactions to food, such as allergies or intolerances, are relatively common. Current medical practice relies primarily on testing for immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactions to identify specific food allergies. However, IgE is involved in acute allergic reactions, and it has limited usefulness f or diagnosing chronic non-acute food allergies. In contrast, immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactions take longer to develop and are not usually acute. IgG levels may increase as a consequence of intestinal permeability. For example, gliadin (found in gluten) breaks down tight junctions (TJs), which are protein complexes that line the GI tract. When TJs break down, intestinal permeability (leaky gut syndrome) increases, allowing incompletely digested proteins to enter the bloodstream and trigger an IgG-based autoimmune reaction. Not surprisingly, IgG levels are often elevated in patients with celiac disease and non-celiacgluten sensitivity. Other diseases, including mood disorders and irritable bowel syndrome, also appear related to IgG-mediatedfood reactions. While IgG testing may be controversial, it remains an important tool for identifying chronic, non-acute food allergies.

AB  - Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a highly prevalent disorder that affects more than 10% of the population. In the past decade, the theoretical underpinning of the concept of FD has begun to change, in light of new data on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder, with a focus on the duodenum. The Rome IV criteria, published in 2016, note that gastroesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome overlap with FD more than expected by chance, suggesting that they may be part of the same disease spectrum. Infection by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) may explain a minority of cases of FD and in the Rome IV criteria H. pylori-associated dyspepsia (defined as symptom relief after eradication therapy) is considered a separate entity. Duodenal inflammation characterized by increased eosinophils and in some cases mast cells, may impair the intestinal barrier. Post-infectious gastroenteritis is now an established risk factor for FD. Other risk factors may include atopy, owning herbivore pets and exposure to antibiotics, together with gastroduodenal microbiome disturbances. Small bowel homing T cells and increased cytokines in the circulation occur in FD, correlating with slow gastric emptying, and a possible association with autoimmune rheumatological disease supports background immune system activation. A genetic predisposition is possible. FD has been linked to psychological disorders, but in some cases psychological distress may be driven by gut mechanisms. Therapeutic options are limited and, aside from responders to H. pylori eradication, provide only modest and temporary relief. Advances in understanding FD may alter clinical practice, and the treatment of duodenal inflammation or microbiome alterations may lead to a cure for a subset of these patients in the future. © 2017 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Objective Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in controlling intestinal epithelial barrier function partly by modulating the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins. We have previously shown differential messenger RNA (mRNA) expression correlated with ultrastructural abnormalities of the epithelial barrier in patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). However, the participation of miRNAs in these differential mRNA-associated findings remains to be established. Our aims were (1) to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in the small bowel mucosa of patients with IBS-D and (2) to explore putative target genes specifically involved in epithelial barrier function that are controlled by specific dysregulated IBS-D miRNAs. Design Healthy controls and patients meeting Rome III IBS-D criteria were studied. Intestinal tissue samples were analysed to identify potential candidates by: (a) miRNA-mRNA profiling; (b) miRNA-mRNA pairing analysis to assess the co-expression profile of miRNA-mRNA pairs; (c) pathway analysis and upstream regulator identification; (d) miRNA and target mRNA validation. Candidate miRNA-mRNA pairs were functionally assessed in intestinal epithelial cells. Results IBS-D samples showed distinct miRNA and mRNA profiles compared with healthy controls. TJ signalling was associated with the IBS-D transcriptional profile. Further validation of selected genes showed consistent upregulation in 75% of genes involved in epithelial barrier function. Bioinformatic analysis of putative miRNA binding sites identified hsa-miR-125b-5p and hsa-miR-16 as regulating expression of the TJ genes CGN (cingulin) and CLDN2 (claudin-2), respectively. Consistently, protein expression of CGN and CLDN2 was upregulated in IBS-D, while the respective targeting miRNAs were downregulated. In addition, bowel dysfunction, perceived stress and depression and number of mast cells correlated with the expression of hsa-miR-125b-5p and hsa-miR-16 and their respective target proteins. Conclusions Modulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier function in IBS-D involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. These molecular mechanisms include miRNAs as master regulators in controlling the expression of TJ proteins and are associated with major clinical symptoms. © 2017 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - Background: Alterations of the small-intestinal permeability (s-IP) might play an essential role in both diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) and celiac disease (CD) patients. Our aims were to analyse in D-IBS patients the symptom profile along with the levels of urinary sucrose (Su), lactulose (La), mannitol (Ma), and circulating biomarkers (zonulin, intestinal fatty acid binding protein - I-FABP, and diamine oxidase - DAO) of the gastrointestinal (GI) barrier function. The pro-inflammatory interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6 and IL-8), the plasma values of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) were also investigated. Besides, these biomarkers were compared with those in CD and healthy controls (HC). Finally, comparisons were performed between D-IBS patients with [D-IBS(+)] and without [D-IBS(-)] increased s-IP according to normal or altered La/Ma ratio. Methods: The study included 39 D-IBS patients, 32 CD patients, and 20 HC. GI permeability was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography determination in the urine of Su and La/Ma ratio. ELISA kits assayed circulating concentrations of zonulin, I-FABP, DAO, IL-6, IL-8, LPS, and TLR-4. The Mann-Whitney or the Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's post-test was used to assess differences among the groups. Results: As for the La/Ma ratio, %Su, and I-FABP levels, D-IBS patients were significantly different from CD, but not HC. IL-6 levels were significantly higher in CD than HC, whereas IL-8 levels were significantly higher in both D-IBS and CD patients than HC. By opposite, LPS, and TLR-4 concentrations did not differ significantly among the groups. When D-IBS patients were categorised according to normal or altered s-IP, D-IBS(+) patients had %La, %Su, I-FABP, and DAO levels significantly higher than D-IBS(-) ones. The inflammatory parameters and markers of bacterial translocation (namely, IL-6 and LPS) were significantly higher in D-IBS(+) patients than D-IBS(-) ones. Conclusions: The present study suggests that two distinct D-IBS subtypes could be identified. The investigation of possible s-IP alterations (i.e., considering the La/Ma ratio) might be useful to assess better and categorise this heterogeneous D-IBS population.

AB  - Patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) often suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms and many are diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Previous studies, including from our laboratory, have demonstrated that the ME/CFS gut bacterial composition is altered and less diverse when compared to healthy individuals. Patients have increased biomarkers of inflammation and leaky gut syndrome. To further investigate dysbiosis in the ME/CFS gut microbiome, we sought to characterize the eukaryotes present in the gut of 49 individuals with ME/CFS and 39 healthy controls. Using 18S rRNA sequencing, we have identified eukaryotes in stool samples of 17 healthy individuals and 17 ME/CFS patients. Our analysis demonstrates a small, nonsignificant decrease in eukaryotic diversity in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy individuals. In addition, ME/CFS patients show a nonsignificant increase in the ratio of fungal phyla Basidiomycota to Ascomycota, which is consistent with ongoing inflammation in ME/CFS. We did not identify specific eukaryotic taxa that are associated with ME/CFS disease status. © 2018 Mandarano et al.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by visceral pain and abnormal bowel habits that are worsened during stress. Evidence also suggests altered intestinal barrier function in IBS. Previously, we demonstrated that stereotaxic application of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) onto the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) induces colonic hyperalgesia and anxiety-like behavior in a rat model, however the effect on intestinal permeability and mucosal function remain to be evaluated. Methods: Male Fischer 344 rats underwent bilateral stereotaxic implantation of CORT or inert cholesterol (CHOL)-containing micropellets (30 μg) onto the dorsal margin of the CeA. Seven days later, colonic tissue was isolated to assess tissue permeability in modified Ussing chambers via transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and macromolecular flux of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Secretory responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS) of submucosal enteric nerves as well as activation with forskolin were used to assess movements of ions across the isolated colonic tissues. In a separate cohort, colonic histology, and mast cell infiltration was assessed. Key Results: Compared to CHOL-implanted controls, we determined that exposing the CeA to elevated levels of CORT significantly increased macromolecular flux across the colonic epithelial layer without changing TEER. Nerve-mediated but not cAMP-mediated active transport was inhibited in response to elevated amygdala CORT. There were no histological changes or increases in mast cell infiltration within colonic tissue from CORT treated animals. Conclusion and Inferences: These observations support a novel role for the CeA as a modulator of nerve-mediated colonic epithelial function. © 2018 Hattay, Prusator, Johnson and Greenwood-Van Meerveld.

AB  - In June 2016, the National Institutes of Health hosted a workshop on functional bowel disorders (FBDs), particularly irritable bowel syndrome, with the objective of elucidating gaps in current knowledge and recommending strategies to address these gaps. The workshop aimed to provide a roadmap to help strategically guide research efforts during the next decade. Attendees were a diverse group of internationally recognized leaders in basic and clinical FBD research. This document summarizes the results of their deliberations, including the following general conclusions and recommendations. First, the high prevalence, economic burden, and impact on quality of life associated with FBDs necessitate an urgent need for improved understanding of FBDs. Second, preclinical discoveries are at a point that they can be realistically translated into novel diagnostic tests and treatments. Third, FBDs are broadly accepted as bidirectional disorders of the brain−gut axis, differentially affecting individuals throughout life. Research must integrate each component of the brain−gut axis and the influence of biological sex, early-life stressors, and genetic and epigenetic factors in individual patients. Fourth, research priorities to improve diagnostic and management paradigms include enhancement of the provider−patient relationship, longitudinal studies to identify risk and protective factors of FBDs, identification of biomarkers and endophenotypes in symptom severity and treatment response, and incorporation of emerging “-omics” discoveries. These paradigms can be applied by well-trained clinicians who are familiar with multimodal treatments. Fifth, essential components of a successful program will include the generation of a large, validated, broadly accessible database that is rigorously phenotyped; a parallel, linkable biorepository; dedicated resources to support peer-reviewed, hypothesis-driven research; access to dedicated bioinformatics expertise; and oversight by funding agencies to review priorities, progress, and potential synergies with relevant stakeholders. © 2018 AGA Institute

AB  - OBJECTIVES:The objective of this study was to determine whether constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is associated with changes in intestinal barrier and secretory function.METHODS:A total of 19 IBS-C patients and 18 healthy volunteers (all females) underwent saccharide excretion assay (0.1 g 13 C mannitol and 1 g lactulose), measurements of duodenal and colonic mucosal barrier (transmucosal resistance (TMR), macromolecular and Escherichia coli Bio-Particle translocation), mucosal secretion (basal and acetylcholine (Ach)-evoked short-circuit current (Isc)), in vivo duodenal mucosal impedance, circulating endotoxins, and colonic tight junction gene expression.RESULTS:There were no differences in the in vivo measurements of barrier function between IBS-C patients and healthy controls: cumulative excretion of 13 C mannitol (0-2 h mean (s.e.m.); IBS-C: 12.1 (0.9) mg vs. healthy: 13.2 (0.8) mg) and lactulose (8-24 h; IBS-C: 0.9 (0.5) mg vs. healthy: 0.5 (0.2) mg); duodenal impedance IBS-C: 729 (65) Ω vs. healthy: 706 (43) Ω; plasma mean endotoxin activity level IBS-C: 0.36 (0.03) vs. healthy: 0.35 (0.02); and in colonic mRNA expression of occludin, zonula occludens (ZO) 1-3, and claudins 1-12 and 14-19. The ex vivo findings were consistent, with no group differences: duodenal TMR (IBS-C: 28.2 (1.9) Ω cm 2 vs. healthy: 29.8 (1.9) Ω cm 2) and colonic TMR (IBS-C: 19.1 (1.1) Ω cm 2 vs. healthy: 17.6 (1.7) Ω cm 2); fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (4 kDa) and E. coli Bio-Particle flux. Colonic basal Isc was similar, but duodenal basal Isc was lower in IBS-C (43.5 (4.5) μA cm -2) vs. healthy (56.9 (4.9) μA cm -2), P=0.05. Ach-evoked Î "Isc was similar.CONCLUSIONS:Females with IBS-C have normal colonic barrier and secretory function. Basal duodenal secretion is decreased in IBS-C. © 2017 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Background and aims Altered intestinal barrier is associated with immune activation and clinical symptoms in diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Increased mucosal antigen load may induce specific responses; however, local antibody production and its contribution to IBS aetiopathogenesis remain undefined. This study evaluated the role of humoral activity in IBS-D. Methods A single mucosal jejunal biopsy, luminal content and blood were obtained from healthy volunteers (H; n=30) and IBS-D (n=49; Rome III criteria) participants. Intraepithelial lymphocytes, mast cells, B lymphocytes and plasma cells were studied by imaging techniques. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis were assessed by microarray and PCR techniques. Blood and luminal immunoglobulins (Igs) were quantified. Gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory atopy and stress and depression were also recorded. Results Patients with IBS-D showed a higher number and activation of mucosal B lymphocytes and plasma cells (p<0.05). Mast cell density was increased in patients with IBS-D (non-atopic) and in close proximity to plasma cells ( p<0.05). Microarray profiling identified differential humoral activity in IBS-D, involving proliferation and activation of B lymphocytes and Igs production ( p<0.001). Mucosal humoral activity was higher in IBS-D, with upregulation of germline transcripts and Ig genes (1.3-fold1.7-fold increase; p<0.05), and increased IgG+ cells and luminal IgG compared with H ( p<0.05), with no differences in blood. Biological markers of humoral activity correlated positively with bowel movements, stool form and depression. Conclusions Enhanced small bowel humoral immunity is a distinctive feature of IBS-D. Mucosal Ig production contributes to local inflammation and clinical manifestations in IBS-D.

AB  - Linaclotide, a synthetic guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) agonist, and the prostone analog, Lubiprostone, are approved to manage chronic idiopathic constipation and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Lubiprostone also protects intestinal mucosal barrier function in ischemia. GC-C signaling regulates local fluid balance and other components of intestinal mucosal homeostasis including epithelial barrier function. The aim of this study was to compare if select dosing regimens differentially affect linaclotide and lubiprostone modulation of ion transport and barrier properties of normal human colonic mucosa. Normal sigmoid colon biopsies from healthy subjects were mounted in Ussing chambers. Tissues were treated with linaclotide, lubiprostone, or vehicle to determine effects on short-circuit current (Isc). Subsequent Isc responses to the cAMP agonist, forskolin, and the calcium agonist, carbachol, were also measured to assess if either drug caused desensitization. Barrier properties were assessed by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance. Isc responses to linaclotide and lubiprostone were significantly higher than vehicle control when administered bilaterally or to the mucosal side only. Single versus cumulative concentrations of linaclotide showed differences in efficacy while cumulative but not single dosing caused desensitization to forskolin. Lubiprostone reduced forskolin responses under all conditions. Linaclotide and lubiprostone exerted a positive effect on TER that was dependent on the dosing regimen. Linaclotide and lubiprostone increase ion transport responses across normal human colon but linaclotide displays increased sensitivity to the dosing regimen used. These findings may have implications for dosing protocols of these agents in patients with constipation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Pharmacological Society and American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

AB  - Background/Aims: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were reported to be responsible for intestinal permeability in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) rats in our previous study. However, whether and how miRNAs regulate visceral hypersensitivity in IBS-D remains largely unknown. Methods: We established the IBS-D rat model and evaluated it using the nociceptive visceral hypersensitivity test, myeloperoxidase activity assay, restraint stress-induced defecation, and electromyographic (EMG) activity. The distal colon was subjected to miRNA microarray analysis followed by isolation and culture of colonic epithelial cells (CECs). Bioinformatic analysis and further experiments, including dual luciferase assays, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were used to detect the expression of miRNAs and how it regulates visceral hypersensitivity in IBS-D rats. Results: The IBS-D rat model was successfully established. A total of 24 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the distal colon of IBS-D rats; 9 were upregulated and 15 were downregulated. Among them, the most significant upregulation was miR-200a, accompanied by downregulation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) and serotonin transporter (SERT). MiR-200a mimic markedly inhibited the expression of CNR1/SERT. Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase assay confirmed that CNR1/SERT are direct targets of miR-200a. Rescue experiments that overexpressed CNR1/SERT significantly abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-200a on the IBS-D rats CECs. Conclusions: This study suggests that miR-200a could induce visceral hyperalgesia by targeting the downregulation of CNR1 and SERT, aggravating or leading to the development and progression of IBS-D. MiR-200a may be a regulator of visceral hypersensitivity, which provides potential targets for the treatment of IBS-D. © 2018 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

AB  - There is an increasing amount of evidence which links the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with food IgG hyperreactivity. Some authors have suggested that food IgG hyperreactivity could be also involved in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). The aim of this study was to compare levels of serum IgG against 39 selected food antigens between three groups of participants: patients with MDD (MDD group), patients with IBS (IBS group) and healthy controls (HC group). The study included 65 participants (22 in the MDD group, 22 in the IBS group and 21 in the HC group). Serum IgG levels were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Medical records, clinical data and laboratory results were collected for the analysis. IgG food hyperreactivity (interpreted as an average of levels of IgG antibodies above 7.5 µg/mL) was detected in 28 (43%) participants, including 14 (64%) from the MDD group, ten (46%) from the IBS group and four (19%) from the HC group. We found differences between extreme IgG levels in MDD versus HC groups and in IBS versus HC groups. Patients with MDD had significantly higher serum levels of total IgG antibodies and IgG against celery, garlic and gluten compared with healthy controls. The MDD group also had higher serum IgG levels against gluten compared with the IBS group. Our results suggest dissimilarity in immune responses against food proteins between the examined groups, with the highest immunoreactivity in the MDD group. Further studies are needed to repeat and confirm these results in bigger cohorts and also examine clinical utility of IgG-based elimination diet in patients with MDD and IBS. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with a multifactorial etiology. Alterations of intestinal motility and immunity, gut-brain interactions, as well as gut microbiota dysbiosis contribute to the development of irritable bowel syndrome. Therefore, gut microbiota modulation by non-absorbable antibiotics is a therapeutic option in patients with IBS. Areascovered: Published articles including patients with irritable bowel syndrome reporting data about rifaximin activity and safety have been searched throughout the literature and selected. Expert opinion: The optimal antibiotic molecule should be local-acting, long-acting and safe-acting. Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic with additional anti-inflammatory and gut microbiota-modulating activity. It is effective in inducing symptoms relief in patients with IBS, even after repeated treatment courses. Rifaximin-related side effects in patients with IBS are reported to be mild and infrequent; microbial resistance is rare and transient, due to the high local concentration of the drug and to the absence of horizontal transmission. Clostridium difficile infection is not usual in patients receiving rifaximin in absence of predisposing conditions such as hospitalization and immunosuppression, which are uncommon in patients affected by irritable bowel syndrome. Nevertheless rifaximin is an antibiotic active against Clostridium difficile infection. Rifaximin has limited metabolic interactions and is not expected to interfere with drug metabolism in patients with normal hepatic function. These properties make rifaximin a safe antibiotic for gut microbiota modulation in patients with IBS. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - AIM To evaluate mucosal baseline mRNA expression of tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG2), interferon gamma (IFNγ), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Myeloid Differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in patients with microscopic enteritis (ME). METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 89 patients with ME of different etiology, which was defined within a 2-year mean period of follow-up. Baseline histological examination was performed on Hematoxylin-Eosin stained sections and CD3 lymphocyte immunohistochemistry was used for intraepithelial lymphocyte count (IELs). ME was defined according to the criteria of Bucharest Consensus Conference. For each patient, formalin embedded biopsy samples of the duodenum referred to the period of ME diagnosis were retrieved. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the amount of mRNA coding for tTG2, IFNγ, TLR2 and MyD88, and the quantity was expressed as fold change compared to controls. Control group was represented by duodenal normal specimens from 15 healthy subjects undergoing endoscopy for functional symptoms. Comparisons among continuous variables were performed by One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni's test. The χ 2 test was used for categorical variables. Pearson's test was used to evaluate correlations. Receiver operating curves were drawn for all four markers to estimate sensitivity and specificity in discriminating the development of CD and GS. RESULTS After a period of follow up of 21.7 ± 11.7 mo, the following diagnoses were achieved: gluten related disorders in 48 subjects (31 CD; 17 GS) and non-gluten related ones in 41 (29 Irritable Bowel Syndrome - IBS; 12 Others). CD patients had the highest tTG2 levels (8.3 ± 4.5). The ANOVA plus Bonferroni analysis showed that CD > Other ME > GS = IBS > negative controls. A cut off value of 2.258 was able to discriminate between CD and GS with a sensitivity of 52.94% and a specificity of 87.1%. Additionally, CD patients had the highest IFNγ levels (8.5 ± 4.1). ANOVA plus Bonferroni demonstrated CD > Other ME > GS = IBS > negative controls. A cut off of 1.853 was able to differentiate CD and GS with a sensitivity of 47.06% and a specificity of 96.77%. Patients with non gluten-related causes of ME exhibited the highest TLR2 levels (6.1 ± 1.9) as follows: Other ME > CD = GS = IBS > negative controls. TLR2 was unable to discriminate CD from GS. Patients with CD overexpressed MyD88 levels similarly to non gluten-related causes of DL (7.8 ± 4.9 and 6.7 ± 2.9), thus CD = Other ME > GS = IBS > negative controls. A cut off of 3.722 was able to differentiate CD from GS with a sensitivity of 52.94% and a specificity of 74.19%. IELs count (15-25 and more than 25/100 enterocytes) strongly correlated with mRNA levels of all tested molecules (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Our results confirm that a single marker is unable to predict a discrimination among ME underlying conditions as well as between CD and GS. Mucosal high levels of tTG and IFNγ mRNA may predict the development of CD more than GS with high specificity, despite an expected low sensitivity. TLR2 does not discriminate the development of CD from GS. MyD88 levels indicate that intestinal permeability is more increased when a severe intestinal damage underlies ME in both gluten related and unrelated conditions. Therefore, the results of the present paper do not seem to show a clear translational value. © The Author(s) 2016. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is the most prevalent cause of foodborne bacterial enteritis worldwide. Patients present with diarrhea and immune responses lead to complications like arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. Although studies exist in animal and cell models, we aimed at a functional and structural characterization of intestinal dysfunction and the involved regulatory mechanisms in human colon. First, in patients' colonic biopsies, sodium malabsorption was identified as an important diarrheal mechanism resulting from hampered epithelial ion transport via impaired epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) β- and γ-subunit. In addition, barrier dysfunction from disrupted epithelial tight junction proteins (claudin-1, -3, -4, -5, and -8), epithelial apoptosis, and appearance of lesions was detected, which cause leak-flux diarrhea and can perpetuate immune responses. Importantly, these effects in human biopsies either represent direct action of Campylobacter jejuni (ENaC impairment) or are caused by proinflammatory signaling (barrier dysfunction). This was revealed by regulator analysis from RNA-sequencing (cytometric bead array-checked) and confirmed in cell models, which identified interferon-γ, TNFα, IL-13, and IL-1β. Finally, bioinformatics' predictions yielded additional information on protective influences like vitamin D, which was confirmed in cell models. Thus, these are candidates for intervention strategies against C. jejuni infection and post-infectious sequelae, which result from the permissive barrier defect along the leaky gut. © 2018 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, especially microbial dysbiosis play role in several GI ailments such as irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Role of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is multifactorial as it involves loss of maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, increased release of pro-inflammatory molecules, and microbial dysbiosis in gut microflora. Some specific pathogens also play a key role in the IBD development. The origin and causation are still in unfathomable condition and the exact root cause is unknown. Recently probiotic studies have been gaining importance because of their positive responses in their IBD experimental results. According to joint Food and Agricultural Organisation/World Health Organisation working group, probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amount confer health benefit on the host. These live beneficial microorganisms are considered helpful in improving gut colonization and perseverance thereby improves prophylactic effect. In the direction of IBD research, a number of studies are needed to standardize its methodology and its applicability on human usage. The particular review presents an overview of gut microflora and its impact on host health, types of IBD and existing therapies to treat this disorder, mechanism of several probiotic actions, role of probiotics in IBD prevention with their supporting evidences. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Aim. Lactulose/mannitol ratio is used to assess intestinal barrier function. Aim of this work was to develop a robust and rapid method for the analysis of lactulose and mannitol in urine by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Lactulose/mannitol ratio has been measured in pediatric patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome. Methods. Calibration curves and raffinose, used as internal standard, were prepared in water: acetonitrile 20: 80. Fifty μL of urine sample was added to 450 μL of internal standard solution. The chromatographic separation was performed using a Luna NH2 column operating at a flow rate of 200 μL/min and eluted with a linear gradient from 20% to 80% water in acetonitrile. Total run time is 9 minutes. The mass spectrometry operates in electrospray negative mode. Method was fully validated according to European Medicine Agency guidelines. Results and Conclusions. Linearity ranged from 10 to 1000 mg/L for mannitol and 2.5 to 1000 mg/L for lactulose. Imprecision in intra- and interassay was lower than 15% for both analytes. Accuracy was higher than 85%. Lactulose/mannitol ratio in pediatric patients is significantly higher than that measured in controls. The presented method, rapid and sensitive, is suitable in a clinical laboratory.

AB  - The spectrum of gluten-related disorders has widened in recent times and includes celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy. The complex of symptoms associated with these diseases, such as diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain may overlap for the gluten related diseases, and furthermore they can be similar to those caused by various other intestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms underlying symptom generation are diverse for all these diseases. Some patients with celiac disease may remain asymptomatic or have only mild gastrointestinal symptoms and thus may qualify for the diagnosis of IBS in the general clinical practice. Similarly, the overlap of symptoms between IBS and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) often creates a dilemma for clinicians. While the treatment of NCGS is exclusion of gluten from the diet, some, but not all, of the patients with IBS also improve on a gluten-free diet. Both IBS and NCGS are common in the general population and both can coexist with each other independently without necessarily sharing a common pathophysiological basis. Although the pathogenesis of NCGS is not well understood, it is likely to be heterogeneous with possible contributing factors such as low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal barrier function and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Innate immunity may also play a pivotal role. One possible inducer of innate immune response has recently been reported to be amylase-trypsin inhibitor, a protein present in wheat endosperm and the source of flour, along with the gluten proteins. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Abdominal pain is a chronic condition experienced by approximately 20% of individuals in the United States. The purpose of the study was to assess the validity of the Gastrointestinal Pain Pointer as a measure of abdominal pain intensity. A prospective longitudinal time-series study design was utilized. The sample included 93 outpatients (58.1% female). Participants met Rome III criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (n = 32) or were healthy controls (n = 61). The Gastrointestinal Pain Pointer, a new electronic pain assessment tool, was used to assess self-reported abdominal pain intensity among participants before and after ingestion of an intestinal permeability test solution across 11 time points over a 5-hour time period. The results were compared with the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire. The Gastrointestinal Pain Pointer was found to be valid in the assessment of abdominal pain intensity. The tool is a novel and valid measure of abdominal pain intensity that enhances the ability for clinicians to better quantify, in real time, patient-related pain outcomes for both clinical care and research. © 2017 Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most frequent functional gastrointestinal disorder. It is characterized by abdominal hypersensitivity, leading to discomfort and pain, as well as altered bowel habits. While it is common for IBS to develop following the resolution of infectious gastroenteritis [then termed postinfectious IBS (PI-IBS)], the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Giardia duodenalis is a cosmopolitan water-borne enteropathogen that causes intestinal malabsorption, diarrhea, and postinfectious complications. Cause-and-effect studies using a human enteropathogen to help investigate the mechanisms of PI-IBS are sorely lacking. In an attempt to establish causality between giardiasis and postinfectious visceral hypersensitivity, this study describes a new model of PI-IBS in neonatal rats infected with G. duodenalis. At 50 days postinfection with G. duodenalis (assemblage A or B), long after the parasite was cleared, rats developed visceral hypersensitivity to luminal balloon distension in the jejunum and rectum, activation of the nociceptive signaling pathway (increased c-fos expression), histological modifications (villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia), and proliferation of mucosal intraepithelial lymphocytes and mast cells in the jejunum, but not in the rectum. G. duodenalis infection also disrupted the intestinal barrier, in vivo and in vitro, which in turn promoted the translocation of commensal bacteria. Giardia-induced bacterial paracellular translocation in vitro correlated with degradation of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-4. The extensive observations associated with gut hypersensitivity described here demonstrate that, indeed, in this new model of postgiardiasis IBS, alterations to the gut mucosa and c-fos are consistent with those associated with PI-IBS and, hence, offer avenues for new mechanistic research in the field. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Berberine hydrochloride (BBH) has a variety of pharmacological activities such as antitumor, antimicrobial, anti-inflammation, and reduce irritable bowel syndrome. However, poor stability and low oral bioavailability limited its usage. Herein, an oil-in-water nanoemulsion system of BBH was developed to improve its stability and oral bioavailability. The pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed for the determination of composition of various nanoemulsions. The nanoemulsions of BBH composed of Labrafil M 1944 CS (oil phase), RH-40 (surfactant), glycerin (co-surfactant), and water (aqueous phase). The O/W nanoemulsion of BBH showed a relative bioavailability of 440.40% compared with unencapsu-lated BBH and was stable in our 6-month stability study. Further, there was a significant increase in intestinal permeability of BBH as assessed by Caco-2 cell monolayers and a significant reduction in efflux of BBH by the multidrug efflux pump P-glycoprotein. This study confirmed that the nanoemulsion formulation could be used as an alternative oral formulation of BBH to improve its stability, oral bioavailability and permeability. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - This article outlines the proposed ‘syntrophic imbalance hypothesis’ for etiology of bacterial endoparasitism diseases. This hypothesis involves microbes (archaea and bacteria) that exist in human body biofilms in syntrophic associations, where bacteria ferment nutrients to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are used by methanogenic archaeons to produce methane. Overgrowth of archaea on human tissues (e.g., in association with intestines, teeth or lungs) results in excessive removal of SCFAs from the biofilms and this triggers bacteria in the free-living biofilm state to convert to the endoparasitic state and become intracellular in host cells where they incite inflammation and disease. The proposed model provides the mechanism to explain dysbiosis etiology of several human diseases, including gingivitis, leaky gut syndrome, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, among others. © 2017

AB  - Neonatal period is characterized by an immature intestinal barrier. Scattered evidence suggests that early life stressful events induce long lasting alterations of intestinal homeostasis mimicking Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Those observations highlighting defect of intestinal barrier by early life stress questioned its potential role as a risk factor for gastrointestinal disorders such as colitis and infections. In this study, we aimed to analyze if maternal separation (MS) in mice mimicks IBS main features. We next addressed whether MS could trigger or exacerbate colitis in genetically predisposed mice and/or enhance susceptibility to gastrointestinal infections in wild type mice. MS induced main features of IBS in adult wild type male mice i.e. intestinal hyperpermeability, visceral hypersensitivity, microbiota dysbiosis, bile acid malabsorption and low grade inflammation in intestine associated with a defect of Paneth cells and the ILC3 population. This breach in mucosal barrier functions in adults was associated with a systemic IgG response against commensal E. coli and increased IFNγ secretion by splenocytes. However, in IL10                             −/−                              mice, MS did not trigger nor worsen colitis. Furthermore, wild type mice submitted to MS did not show increase susceptibility to gastrointestinal infections (S. Typhimurium, L. monocytogenes or T. gondii) compared to controls. Altogether, our results identify MS in mice as a good experimental model for IBS mimicking all the main features. In addition, early life stress, even though it has long lasting consequences on intestinal homeostasis, does not constitute a facilitating factor to colitis in predisposed individuals nor to gastrointestinal infections in wild type mice.                          © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Increased intestinal barrier permeability has been correlated with aging and disease, including type 2 diabetes, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis and irritable bowel syndrome. The prevalence of these ailments has risen together with an increase in industrial food processing and food additive consumption. Additives, including sugar, metal oxide nanoparticles, surfactants and sodium chloride, have all been suggested to increase intestinal permeability. We used two complementary model systems to examine the effects of food additives on gut barrier function: a Drosophila in vivo model and an in vitro human cell co-culture model. Of the additives tested, intestinal permeability was increased most dramatically by high sugar. High sugar also increased feeding but reduced gut and overall animal size. We also examined how food additives affected the activity of a gut mucosal defense factor, intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), which fluctuates with bacterial load and affects intestinal permeability. We found that high sugar reduced IAP activity in both models. Artificial manipulation of the microbiome influenced gut permeability in both models, revealing a complex relationship between the two. This study extends previous work in flies and humans showing that diet can play a role in the health of the gut barrier. Moreover, simple models can be used to study mechanisms underlying the effects of diet on gut permeability and function. © 2018. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Background and Aims: Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed antibiotic, which has shown efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. However, the mechanism on how it effects in IBS is still incompletely defined. In this study, Trichinella spiralis-infected post-infectious (PI) IBS mouse model was used, to assess the action of rifaximin on visceral hypersensitivity, barrier function, gut inflammation, and microbiota. Methods: Post-infectious IBS model was established by T. spiralis infection in mice. Rifaximin were administered to PI-IBS mice for seven consecutive days. The abdominal withdrawal reflex and threshold of colorectal distention were employed to evaluate visceral sensitivity. Smooth muscle contractile response was recorded in the organ bath. Intestinal permeability was measured by Ussing chamber. Expression of tight junction protein and cytokines were measured by Western blotting. Ilumina miseq platform was used to analyze bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA. Results: Post-infectious IBS mice treated with rifaximin exhibited decreased abdominal withdrawal reflex score, increased threshold, reduced contractile response, and intestinal permeability. Rifaximin also suppressed the expression of interleukin-12 and interleukin-17 and promoted the expression of the major tight junction protein occludin. Furthermore, rifaximin did not change the composition and diversity, and the study reavealed that rifaximin had a tiny effect on the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in this PI-IBS model. Conclusions: Rifaximin alleviated visceral hypersensitivity, recovered intestinal barrier function, and inhibited low-grade inflammation in colon and ileum of PI-IBS mouse model. Moreover, rifaximin exerts anti-inflammatory effects with only a minimal effect on the overall composition and diversity of the gut microbiota in this model. © 2017 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Administration of the probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) decreases visceral pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Mutation of clbA, a gene involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including colibactin, was previously shown to abrogate EcN probiotic activity. Here, we show that EcN, but not an isogenic clbA mutant, produces an analgesic lipopeptide. We characterize lipoamino acids and lipopeptides produced by EcN but not by the mutant by online liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. One of these lipopeptides, C12AsnGABAOH, is able to cross the epithelial barrier and to inhibit calcium flux induced by nociceptor activation in sensory neurons via the GABAB receptor. C12AsnGABAOH inhibits visceral hypersensitivity induced by nociceptor activation in mice. Thus, EcN produces a visceral analgesic, which could be the basis for the development of new visceral pain therapies. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Visceral pain and intestinal dysbiosis are associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a common functional gastrointestinal disorder without available efficient therapies. In this study, a decrease of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii presence has been observed in an IBS-like rodent model induced by a neonatal maternal separation (NMS) stress. Moreover, it was investigated whether F. prausnitzii may have an impact on colonic sensitivity. The A2-165 reference strain, but not its supernatant, significantly decreased colonic hypersensitivity induced by either NMS in mice or partial restraint stress in rats. This effect was associated with a reinforcement of intestinal epithelial barrier. Thus, F. prausnitzii exhibits anti-nociceptive properties, indicating its potential to treat abdominal pain in IBS patients.

AB  - Background: Biological sex plays a prominent role in the prevalence and severity of a number of important stress-related gastrointestinal and immune-related diseases including IBS and allergy/anaphylaxis. Despite the establishment of sex differences in these diseases, the underlying mechanisms contributing to sex differences remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of biological sex on mast cells (MCs), an innate immune cell central to the pathophysiology of many GI and allergic disorders. Methods: Twelve-week-old C57BL/6 male and female mice were exposed to immunological stress (2 h of IgE-mediated passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA)) or psychological stress (1 h of restraint stress (RS)) and temperature, clinical scores, serum histamine, and intestinal permeability (for RS) were measured. Primary bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) were harvested from male and female mice and analyzed for MC degranulation, signaling pathways, mediator content, and RNA transcriptome analysis. Results: Sexually dimorphic responses were observed in both models of PSA and RS and in primary MCs. Compared with male mice, female mice exhibited increased clinical scores, hypothermia, and serum histamine levels in response to PSA and had greater intestinal permeability and serum histamine responses to RS. Primary BMMCs from female mice exhibited increased release of β-hexosaminidase, histamine, tryptase, and TNF-α upon stimulation with IgE/DNP and A23187. Increased mediator release in female BMMCs was not associated with increased upstream phospho-tyrosine signaling pathways or downstream Ca2+ mobilization. Instead, increased mediator release in female MCs was associated with markedly increased capacity for synthesis and storage of MC granule-associated immune mediators as determined by MC mediator content and RNA transcriptome analysis. Conclusions: These results provide a new understanding of sexual dimorphic responses in MCs and have direct implications for stress-related diseases associated with a female predominance and MC hyperactivity including irritable bowel syndrome, allergy, and anaphylaxis. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Background/Aims Wistar rat dams exposed to limited nesting stress (LNS) from post-natal days (PND) 2 to 10 display erratic maternal behavior, and their pups show delayed maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and impaired epithelial barrier at PND10 and a visceral hypersensitivity at adulthood. Little is known about the impact of early life stress on the offspring before adulthood and the influence of sex. We investigated whether male and female rats previously exposed to LNS displays at weaning altered corticosterone, intestinal permeability, and microbiota. Methods Wistar rat dams and litters were maintained from PND2 to 10 with limited nesting/bedding materials and thereafter reverted to normal housing up to weaning (PND21). Control litters had normal housing. At weaning, we monitored body weight, corticosterone plasma levels (enzyme immunoassay), in vivo intestinal to colon permeability (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 kDa) and fecal microbiota (DNA extraction and amplification of the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene). Results At weaning, LNS pups had hypercorticosteronemia and enhanced intestinal permeability with females > males while body weights were similar. LNS decreased fecal microbial diversity and induced a distinct composition characterized by increased abundance of Gram positive cocci and reduction of fiber-degrading, butyrate-producing, and mucus-resident microbes. Conclusions These data indicate that chronic exposure to LNS during the first week post-natally has sustained effects monitored at weaning including hypercorticosteronemia, a leaky gut, and dysbiosis. These alterations may impact on the susceptibility to develop visceral hypersensitivity in adult rats and have relevance to the development of irritable bowel syndrome in childhood. © 2017 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

AB  - Background/Aims: Intestinal permeability and stress have been implicated in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Cytokeratin 8 (CK8), for the first time, has been shown to mediate corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-induced changes in intestinal permeability in animal models of IBS. In this study, we investigated the regulatory effects of CRF on the permeability of human intestinal epithelial cells through the CK8-mediated tight junction. Methods: The expression levels of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1) and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 (CRFR2) on the HT29 cell surface were determined by immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. After treatment with 100 nM CRF for 72 h, the translocation of FITC-labelled dextran was measured in a transwell chamber; the structural changes of tight junctions were observed under transmission electron microscopy; the expression levels of CK8, F-actin and tight junction proteins ZO-1, claudin-1, and occludin were detected by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. The activity of RhoA was detected by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the effects of CRF on intestinal epithelial permeability were examined in CK8-silenced HT29 cells, which were constructed by shRNA interference. Results: CRF treatment increased FITC-labelled dextran permeability, caused the opening of tight junctions, induced increased fluorescence intensity of CK8 and decreased the intensities of ZO-1, claudin-1, and occludin, together with structural disruption. The expression levels of F-actin, occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 were downregulated. RhoA activity peaked at 30 min after CRF treatment. CRF-induced increased permeability, and downregulation of claudin-1 and occludin were not blocked by CK8 silencing. Nevertheless, CK8 silencing blocked the effects of CRF regarding the decrease in the expression levels of F-action and ZO-1 and increase in RhoA activity. Conclusion: CRF may increase intestinal epithelial permeability by upregulating CK8 expression, activating the RhoA signalling pathway, promoting intestinal epithelial actin remodelling, and decreasing the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1. Other CK8-independent pathways may be involved in the downregulation of claudin-1 and occludin, which might also contribute to increased intestinal epithelial permeability. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Cannabinoid receptors are fundamentally involved in all aspects of intestinal physiology, such as motility, secretion, and epithelial barrier function. They are part of a broader entity, the so-called endocannabinoid system which also includes their endocannabinoid ligands and the ligands’ synthesizing/degrading enzymes. The system has a strong impact on the pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract and is believed to maintain homeostasis in the gut by controlling hypercontractility and by promoting regeneration after injury. For instance, genetic knockout of cannabinoid receptor 1 leads to inflammation and cancer of the intestines. Derivatives of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, such as nabilone and dronabinol, activate cannabinoid receptors and have been introduced into the clinic to treat chemotherapy-induced emesis and loss of appetite; however, they may cause many psychotropic side effects. New drugs that interfere with endocannabinoid degradation to raise endocannabinoid levels circumvent this obstacle and could be used in the future to treat emesis, intestinal inflammation, and functional disorders associated with visceral hyperalgesia. © © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - The gut barrier is a functional unit, organized as a multi-layer system, made up of two main components: a physical barrier surface, which prevents bacterial adhesion and regulates paracellular diffusion to the host tissues, and a deep functional barrier, that is able to discriminate between pathogens and commensal microorganisms, organizing the immune tolerance and the immune response to pathogens. Other mechanisms, such as gastric juice and pancreatic enzymes (which both have antibacterial properties) participate in the luminal integrity of the gut barrier. From the outer layer to the inner layer, the physical barrier is composed of gut microbiota (that competes with pathogens to gain space and energy resources, processes the molecules necessary to mucosal integrity and modulates the immunological activity of deep barrier), mucus (which separates the intraluminal content from more internal layers and contains antimicrobial products and secretory IgA), epithelial cells (which form a physical and immunological barrier) and the innate and adaptive immune cells forming the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (which is responsible for antigen sampling and immune responses). Disruption of the gut barrier has been associated with many gastrointestinal diseases, but also with extra-intestinal pathological condition, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, allergic diseases or autism spectrum disorders. The maintenance of a healthy intestinal barrier is therefore of paramount importance in children, for both health and economic reasons. Many drugs or compounds used in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders act through the restoration of a normal intestinal permeability. Several studies have highlighted the role of probiotics in the modulation and reduction of intestinal permeability, considering the strong influence of gut microbiota in the modulation of the function and structure of gut barrier, but also on the immune response of the host. To date, available weapons for the maintenance and repair of gut barrier are however few, even if promising. Considerable efforts, including both a better understanding of the gut barrier features and mechanisms in health and disease, and the development of new pharmacological approaches for the modulation of gut barrier components, are needed for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal diseases associated with gut barrier impairment.

AB  - Disturbed intestinal epithelial barrier and mucosal micro-inflammation characterize irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Despite intensive research demonstrating ovarian hormones modulation of IBS severity, there is still limited knowledge on the mechanisms underlying female predominance in this disorder. Our aim was to identify molecular pathways involved in epithelial barrier dysfunction and female predominance in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients. Total RNA and protein were obtained from jejunal mucosal biopsies from healthy controls and IBS-D patients meeting the Rome III criteria. IBS severity was recorded based on validated questionnaires. Gene and protein expression profiles were obtained and data integrated to explore biological and molecular functions. Results were validated by western blot. Tight junction signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, regulation of actin-based motility by Rho, and cytoskeleton signaling were differentially expressed in IBS-D. Decreased TESK1-dependent cofilin 1 phosphorylation (pCFL1) was confirmed in IBS-D, which negatively correlated with bowel movements only in female participants. In conclusion, deregulation of cytoskeleton dynamics through TESK1/CFL1 pathway underlies epithelial intestinal dysfunction in the small bowel mucosa of IBS-D, particularly in female patients. Further understanding of the mechanisms involving sex-mediated regulation of mucosal epithelial integrity may have significant preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic implications for IBS. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The mammalian gastrointestinal tract is much more complex than previously appreciated. A single layer of epithelial cells covers the entire gastrointestinal tract, so providing the largest interface with the environment. The gut epithelium is a sensor of the luminal environment, not only controlling digestive, absorptive, and secretory functions, but also relaying information to the mucosal immune, vascular and nervous systems. These functions involve a complex array of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and cell types that elaborate growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix proteins. Moreover, enteric microbes may hijack PRR-activated pathways as part of their pathogenic arsenal through 'host mimicry'. Understanding the cross-talk between enteric microbiota and the host under both physiological and pathological circumstances may provide key information on the pathogenesis of local as well as systemic diseases. This knowledge may potentially lead to the identification of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these disorders. © 2009 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background: An altered intestinal mucosal barrier has been demonstrated in subsets of patients with IBS and FAP and may be an additional biological factor contributing to symptom generation in children with FD. The objective of this study was to determine if intestinal permeability is increased in children/adolescents with functional dyspepsia (FD) and whether intestinal permeability is correlated with mucosal inflammation and/or symptoms of anxiety or depression in this population. Methods. A sugar absorption test was performed in 19 patients with FD and 19 controls. Anxiety and depression were assessed in both groups utilizing a standard questionnaire. In FD patients, duodenal mean and peak mast cell and eosinophil densities were determined. Results: Intestinal permeability as measured by the sugar absorption test did not differ between children with FD and controls. In children with FD, there was no correlation between permeability and mast cell density, eosinophil density, anxiety scores, or depression scores, respectively. Conclusions: Pediatric FD does not appear to be associated with increased small bowel intestinal permeability, however, there are some limitations to the current study. Trial registration.

AB  - Background & Aims Acute infectious gastroenteritis increases the risk for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). Children are particularly vulnerable to gastroenteritis because of the immaturity of their intestinal barrier, enteric nervous system, and immune response to pathogens. We investigated whether acute gastroenteritis in early life increases the risk of IBS and FD throughout adulthood. Methods In 1994, we identified and monitored a single culture-proven foodborne Salmonella enteritidis outbreak that involved 1811 patients (mostly pediatric) in Bologna, Italy. Clinical data were collected and a prospective, controlled, cohort study was designed. Long-term effects were assessed by mailing a questionnaire to 757 subjects 16 years after the outbreak (when all of the children were adults). We randomly selected a cohort of 250 adults exposed to Salmonella as children, all 127 individuals exposed as adults, and a cohort of nonexposed participants matched for number, age, sex, and area of residence (controls). Results Among 198 exposed participants, 64 reported FD (32.3%), compared with 51 of 188 controls (27.1%; P =.268). Among 204 exposed participants, 75 reported having IBS (36.8%) compared with 44 of 189 controls (23.3%; P =.004). The odds ratio for IBS among people exposed to the Salmonella was 1.92 (95% confidence interval: 1.23-2.98). The prevalence of IBS was higher in individuals exposed Salmonella as children than in controls (35.3% vs 20.5%; P =.008), but not in individuals exposed as adults, compared with controls. After multivariate logistic regression, post-infectious IBS was independently associated with anxiety and FD. Conclusions Based on data collected from a single culture-proven foodborne Salmonella enteritidis outbreak in 1994, Salmonella-induced gastroenteritis during childhood (but not adulthood) is a risk factor for IBS. © 2014 by the AGA Institute.

AB  - There is increasingly convincing evidence supporting the participation of the gut microenvironment in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Studies particularly suggest an interplay between luminal factors (eg, foods and bacteria residing in the intestine), the epithelial barrier, and the mucosal immune system. Decreased expression and structural rearrangement of tight junction proteins in the small bowel and colon leading to increased intestinal permeability have been observed, particularly in postinfectious IBS and in IBS with diarrhea. These abnormalities are thought to contribute to the outflow of antigens through the leaky epithelium, causing overstimulation of the mucosal immune system. Accordingly, subsets of patients with IBS show higher numbers and an increased activation of mucosal immunocytes, particularly mast cells. Immune factors, released by these cells, including proteases, histamine, and prostanoids, participate in the perpetuation of the permeability dysfunction and contribute to the activation of abnormal neural responses involved in abdominal pain perception and changes in bowel habits. All these mechanisms represent new targets for therapeutic approaches in IBS. Probiotics are an attractive therapeutic option in IBS given their recognized safety and by virtue of positive biological effects they can exert on the host. Of importance for the IBS pathophysiology is that preclinical studies have shown that selective probiotic strains exhibit potentially useful properties including anti-inflammatory effects, improvement of mucosal barrier homeostasis, beneficial effects on intestinal microbiota, and a reduction of visceral hypersensitivity. The effect of probiotics on IBS is positive in most randomized, controlled studies, although the gain over the placebo is small. Identifying tailored probiotic approaches for subgroups of IBS patients represents a challenge for the future. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity is one of the hallmarks in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pathophysiology. Stress is well known to affect visceral sensitivity in humans and rodents, an effect which is associated in part with alterations of intestinal epithelial permeability in rodents. Although the pathophysiology of visceral hypersensitivity is still unclear, two key factors have been identified as playing a major role in its modulation, namely peripheral corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and mast cells. In a recent study in Neurogastroenterology and Motility, van den Wijngaard et al. demonstrate that the mast-cell dependent visceral hypersensitivity observed in maternally separated rats after an acute exposure to a psychological stress can be prevented but not reversed by the peripherally restricted CRF receptor antagonist, α-helical CRF 9-41. They further show that the preventive effect of the CRF receptor antagonist is linked to a stabilization of mast cells and maintenance of the epithelial barrier at the colonic level. These data suggest that post stress mast cell activation and subsequent visceral hypersensitivity are not targeted by peripheral CRF receptor antagonists. These novel insights in the role of peripheral CRF in the modulation of stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity add to our growing understanding of the mechanisms that may lie at the origin of visceral pain disturbances following stress and will contribute to enhance the development of drugs that may have potential therapeutic benefits for IBS patients. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in soldiers in combat or high-pressure operational situations and often lead to compromised performance. Underlying mechanisms are unclear, but neuroendocrine dysregulation, immune activation and increased intestinal permeability may be involved in stress-related GI dysfunction. Aim To study the effects of prolonged, intense, mixed psychological and physical stress on intestinal permeability, systemic inflammatory and stress markers in soldiers during high-intensity combat-training. Methods In 37 male army medical rapid response troops, GI symptoms, stress markers, segmental intestinal permeability using the 4-sugar test (sucrose, lactulose, mannitol and sucralose) and immune activation were assessed during the 4th week of an intense combat-training and a rest period. Results Combat-training elicited higher stress, anxiety and depression scores (all P < 0.01) as well as greater incidence and severity of GI symptoms [irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity score (IBS-SSS), P < 0.05] compared with rest. The IBS-SSS correlated with depression (r = 0.41, P < 0.01) and stress (r = 0.40, P < 0.01) ratings. Serum levels of cortisol, interleukin-6, and tumour necrosis factor-α, and segmental GI permeability increased during combat-training compared with rest (all P < 0.05). The lactulose:mannitol ratio was higher in soldiers with GI symptoms (IBS-SSS ≥75) during combat-training than those without (IBS-SSS <75) (P < 0.05). Conclusions Prolonged combat-training not only induces the expected increases in stress, anxiety and depression, but also GI symptoms, pro-inflammatory immune activation and increased intestinal permeability. Identification of subgroups of individuals at high-risk of GI compromise and of long-term deleterious effects of operational stress as well as the development of protective measures will be the focus of future studies. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Abnormal gastrointestinal permeability has been linked to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The lactulose-to-mannitol ratio is traditionally used to assess small intestine permeability while sucralose and sucrose are used to assess colonic and gastric permeability respectively. We used a single 4-probe test solution to assess permeability throughout the gastrointestinal tract in IBS patients and healthy controls by measuring the recovery of the probes in urine after ingestion using a modified liquid chromatography mass spectrometry protocol. Methods: Fasting participants (N = 59) drank a permeability test solution (100. ml: sucralose, sucrose, mannitol, and lactulose). Urine was collected over a 5-h period and kept frozen until analysis. Urinary sugar concentrations were measured using a liquid chromatography/triple quadruple mass spectrometer. Results: Colonic permeability was significantly lower in IBS patients when compared to healthy controls (p = 0.011). Gastric and small intestinal permeability did not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the clinical potential of this non-invasive method for assessing alterations in gastrointestinal permeability in patients with IBS. © 2013 .

AB  - Fagopyrum cymosum (Trev.) Meisn (Fag) is a herb rhizome which has been widely used to treat diseases. To investigate the effects and mechanisms of the Fag on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), in vivo neonatal pups maternal separation (NMS) combined with intracolonic infusion of acetic acid (AA) was employed to establish IBS rat models. Fag reduced their visceral hyperalgesia and the whole gut permeability, ameliorated colonic mucosa inflammation and injury, and upregulated the expression of decreased tight junction proteins (TJs) of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 (except ZO-2) in colonic epithelium. Caco-2 monolayer cells were incubated with TNF-α and IFN-γ in vitro to establish an epithelial barrier dysfunction model whose transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) depended more on dose of Fag than that of the controls, and whose TJs levels were lower than those of the controls. Fag upregulated the NP-40 insoluble and soluble components of the four TJs markedly in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that Fag alleviated the hyperalgesia of IBS rats by reducing intestinal inflammation and enhancing mucosal epithelial function after regulating the structure and function of TJs. © 2012 Lina Liu et al.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder in which the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood; however, increased intestinal permeability in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients has been reported. Here we demonstrate that diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) patients display increased intestinal permeability. We have also found that increased intestinal membrane permeability is associated with visceral and thermal hypersensitivity in this subset of D-IBS patients. We evaluated 54 D-IBS patients and 22 controls for intestinal membrane permeability using the lactulose/mannitol method. All subjects ingested 5 g of lactulose and 2 g of mannitol in 100 ml of water after which their urine was collected. We also evaluated the mean mechanical visual analogue scale (M-VAS) pain rating to nociceptive thermal and visceral stimulation in all subjects. All study participants also completed the FBDSI scale. Approximately 39% of diarrhea-predominant IBS patients had increased intestinal membrane permeability as measured by the lactulose/mannitol ratio. These IBS patients also demonstrated higher M-VAS pain intensity reading scale. Interestingly, the IBS patients with hypersensitivity and increased intestinal permeability had a higher FBDSI score (100.8 ± 5.4) than IBS patients with normal membrane permeability and sensitivity (51.6 ± 12.7) and controls (6.1 ± 5.6) (p < 0.001). A subset of D-IBS patients had increased intestinal membrane permeability that was associated with an increased FBDSI score and increased hypersensitivity to visceral and thermal nociceptive pain stimuli. Thus, increased intestinal membrane permeability in D-IBS patients may lead to more severe IBS symptoms and hypersensitivity to somatic and visceral stimuli. © 2009 International Association for the Study of Pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) patients show altered epithelial permeability and mucosal micro-inflammation in both proximal and distal regions of the intestine. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular events and mechanisms and the clinical role of upper small intestinal alterations. METHODS: Clinical assessment and a jejunal biopsy was obtained in IBS-D patients and healthy subjects. Routine histology and immunohistochemistry was performed in all participants to assess the number of mast cells (MCs) and intraepithelial lymphocytes. RNA in tissue samples was isolated to identify genes showing consistent differential expression by microarray analysis followed by pathway and network analysis in order to identify the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes in IBS-D. Gene and protein expression of tight junction (TJ) components was also assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and confocal microscopy to evaluate the pathways identified by gene expression analysis. RESULTS: The analysis reveals a strong association between the transcript signature of the jejunal mucosa of IBS-D and intestinal permeability, MC biology, and TJ signaling. The expression of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) was reduced in IBS-D at both gene and protein level, with protein redistribution from the TJ to the cytoplasm. Remarkably, our analysis disclosed significant correlation between ZO proteins, MC activation, and clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: IBS-D manifestations are linked to molecular alterations involving MC-related dysregulation of TJ functioning in the jejunal mucosa. © 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder predominantly found in females. The diagnosis is established by anamnestic criteria and the absence of another underlying disease. The pathogenesis of the different symptoms is still not known in detail, but new knowledge on the role of the intestinal bacteria, gut barrier function and the enteral immune system has offered new perspectives on some areas of IBS and led to the introduction of new therapeutic concepts. There is evidence that the composition of the intestinal bacteria is different in people with IBS compared with controls and that this difference plays an important role in altering epithelial barrier function and the intestinal immune response. It was recently demonstrated that a low-grade inflammation can be present in people with IBS and that bacterial infiltration and activation of mast cells in proximity to nerves in the mucosa is may be involved in the pathogenesis of pain. A change in the intestinal environment can be achieved using specific antibiotics or prebiotics and probiotics. Prebiotics and probiotics have been demonstrated to have many beneficial effects: they are able to change the intestinal environment and interact with the epithelial barrier and the intestinal immune system. The aim of this review is to demonstrate new insights into the pathogenesis of IBS and to show the benefits and limitations of the newly proposed prebiotic and probiotic treatments. Prebiotics and probiotics change the bacterial composition of the gut and modulate epithelial barrier function and the immune response. Although the prebiotic concept is interesting for people with IBS, only limited data are available and no general recommendation can be given at present. The data on probiotics are much more extensive and show that certain strains are efficacious in the treatment of several symptoms of IBS. It seems that specific probiotics are more active in the treatment of single symptoms than the treatment of IBS as a whole. There is still a need for further studies to discover the most effective species and strains, the right doses and whether a combination of probiotics is better than a single strain; only then will it be possible to recommend general probiotic treatment for people with IBS. Furthermore, more studies using both prebiotics and probiotics (synbiotics) are necessary because of their synergistic effects. © 2011 Touch Briefings.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), once thought to be a psychosomatic disease, is being considered to be more organic. Post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS), defined as acute onset IBS (by Rome criteria) after gastrointestinal infection in an individual without prior IBS with two or more of the followings: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, a positive stool culture. The recent and old literature of PI-IBS will be reviewed. Future directions for research will be presented. Methods: Literature on PI-IBS was reviewed by electronic search and cross references of these papers. Results: Interest in studies on PI-IBS, which was described five to six decades ago, re-surfaced recently. 3.6 to 32% patients with acute gastroenteritis develop PI-IBS during 3-12 month follow-up. PI-IBS is commonly diarrhea predominant. Factors implicated in development include nature of pathogens, duration and severity of diarrhea, younger age, female gender and psychological co-morbidities like anxiety and depression. The pathogenesis of PI-IBS is largely related to continuing gut inflammation due to inability of the host to contain the inflammatory reaction, altered gut microbiota, increased intestinal permeability, muscle hyper-contractility and visceral hypersensitivity. There could be an overlap between PI-IBS and post-infectious malabsorption syndrome (PI-MAS), popularly known as tropical sprue. Conclusions: Development of IBS in a subset of patients with acute gastroenteritis is uncontested. This is expected to open a paradigm shift in understanding the pathogenesis of IBS. Future studies should address the issue of overlap of PI-IBS and PI-MAS. Exploring the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of PI-IBS may help to design preventive and therapeutic strategies. © 2011 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Compelling evidence indicates sex and gender differences in epidemiology, symptomatology, pathophysiology, and treatment outcome in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Based on the female predominance as well as the correlation between IBS symptoms and hormonal status, several models have been proposed to examine the role of sex hormones in gastrointestinal (GI) function including differences in GI symptoms expression in distinct phases of the menstrual cycle, in pre- and post-menopausal women, during pregnancy, hormonal treatment or after oophorectomy. Sex hormones may influence peripheral and central regulatory mechanisms of the brain-gut axis involved in the pathophysiology of IBS contributing to the alterations in visceral sensitivity, motility, intestinal barrier function, and immune activation of intestinal mucosa. Sex differences in stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system, neuroimmune interactions triggered by stress, as well as estrogen interactions with serotonin and corticotropin-releasing factor signaling systems are being increasingly recognized. A concept of "microgenderome" related to the potential role of sex hormone modulation of the gut microbiota is also emerging. Significant differences between IBS female and male patients regarding symptomatology and comorbidity with other chronic pain syndromes and psychiatric disorders, together with differences in efficacy of serotonergic medications in IBS patients confirm the necessity for more sex-tailored therapeutic approach in this disorder. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

AB  - Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the pathologic role of food in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nevertheless, healthcare providers often avoid addressing diet with their patients because of a lack of training, guideline consensus, and high-quality data. Recent literature supports the existence of a subgroup of IBS patients with undiagnosed nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), a term that is used to describe individuals who experience gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms as a result of immunologic, morphologic, or symptomatic abnormalities that are precipitated by the ingestion of gluten. NCGS represents an important subgroup of patients with IBS who are highly treatable via dietary modification. Gluten may influence gastrointestinal symptoms through immune activation or alteration of intestinal permeability, but the true role of food in functional gastrointestinal symptomatology remains unclear. For example, gluten is just 1 component of the complex milieu of nutrients found in wheat and related grains, and NCGS likely represents only the tip of the iceberg as it pertains to the role of food in IBS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous condition and defined according to symptoms. Low-grade inflammation has been associated with IBS, particularly that following infection, but whether altered intestinal permeability profiles relate to irritable bowel subtype or onset is uncertain. Our aim was to compare small and large intestinal permeability in various subtypes of IBS to healthy controls. METHODS: Intestinal permeability was measured using 1.8 MBq of 51Cr-EDTA and collecting urine over 24 h; Study 1: patients with diarrhea-predominant postinfectious IBS (N = 15), constipation-predominant IBS (N = 15), and healthy controls (N = 15); Study 2: two groups of diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS), one with a history of onset after acute gastroenteritis (postinfectious) (N = 15) and the other without such a history (nonpostinfectious) (N = 15) both compared with healthy controls (N = 12). RESULTS: Permeability expressed as percentage of total dose excreted in urine (median [inter-quartile range]). Study 1: Proximal small intestinal permeability was increased in postinfectious IBS (0.19 [0.12-0.23]) in contrast to constipated IBS (0.085 [0.043-0.13]) and controls (0.07 [0.035-0.19]) (p = 0.02). IBS patients with eczema, asthma, or hayfever had increased proximal small intestinal permeability compared with IBS patients without atopy (p = 0.02). Study 2: Small intestinal permeability was greater in nonpostinfectious diarrhea-predominant IBS (0.84 [0.69-1.49]) compared with postinfectious IBS (0.43 [0.29-0.63], p = 0.028) or controls (0.27 [0.2-0.39]), p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Small intestinal permeability is frequently abnormal in diarrhea-predominant IBS. Those without a history of infectious onset appear to have a more severe defect. © 2006 by Am.

AB  - Background/Aims: Small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a frequent finding in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Many patients with IBS also have abnormal intestinal permeability, which is probably due to low-grade inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. Our aim was to verify the relationship between SIBO and small-intestinal permeability in IBS patients. Methods: A cohort of 38 IBS patients (20 women and 18 men; age range 16-70 years; mean age 40.2 years) with symptoms that fulfilled Rome-II criteria, and 12 healthy controls (5 women and 7 men; age range 25-52 years; mean age: 37.8 years) were recruited. All subjects underwent lactulose breath tests (LBTs) and intestinal permeability tests using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350/400 retrieval ratio. Results: A positive LBT was found in 18.4% (7/38) of patients with IBS and 8.3% (1/12) of control subjects. Intestinal permeability was significantly increased in patients with IBS compared with the normal controls (0.82±0.09 vs 0.41±0.05 [mean±SD], respectively; p<0.05). However, the intestinal permeability did not differ significantly between IBS patients with a positive LBT and those with a negative LBT (0.90±0.13 and 0.80±0.11, respectively; p>0.05). Conclusions: Intestinal permeability was increased in patients with IBS, but this finding did not correlated with the occurrence of SIBO.

AB  - Background/Aims: Although mucosal mast cell tryptase is known to significantly increase intestinal permeability, the relationship between mucosal mast cells and intestinal permeability remains unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation among intestinal permeability, tryptase activity and mucosal mast cell count. Methods Rectal biopsies from 16 patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and 7 normal subjects were assessed for tryptase activity and macromolecular permeability using horseradish peroxidase in Ussing chambers. In addition, mucosal mast cell levels were immunohistochemically quantified via image analysis. Results Rectal biopsy of tissues from IBS-D patients showed significantly increased permeability compared with those from normal controls (0.644 ± 0.08 and 0.06 ± 0.00 ng/2 hr/mm2, P < 0.01). Tryptase activity was also substantially higher in rectal biopsy samples from IBS-D patients than those from normal controls (0.86 ± 0.18 and 0.28 ± 0.04 mU/mg protein, P < 0.05). Mucosal mast cell counts were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). However, correlation analysis revealed that only mucosal mast cell count was significantly correlated with intestinal permeability in IBS-D patients (r = 0.558, P < 0.05). Conclusions This study demonstrated a positive correlation between the number of mucosal mast cells and intestinal permeability, suggesting that mucosal mast cells play an important role for increased intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D. © 2013 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

AB  - Stress can lead to the manifestation of functional gastrointestinal disorders, the most prominent being irritable bowel disorder. The present study investigated the impact zingerone in ameliorating chronic water stress induced irritable bowel disorder, brain gut axis dysfunction and dysregulation of the intestinal barrier due to oxidative stress. Rats were randomly allocated to groups and subjected to chronic water stress for a period of 21 days for 1 h and the fecal pellet output was measured. At the end of chronic stress, behavioral assessment for anxiety like behavior was recorded and plasma corticosterone levels were measured 60 min after water stress. The colonic transit was determined, levels of oxidative and antioxidant biomarkers were measured in the colon homogenate. Myeloperoxidase activity was determined as an indirect index of neutrophil infiltration. Chronic water stress increased the rate of colonic transit, fecal output, induced behavioral changes, and decreased antioxidant levels. An increase in lipid peroxide levels, catalase and corticosterone was observed. Mast cell infiltration was evident in the stressed group. Zingerone significantly reduced colonic transit, fecal output, neutrophil infiltration, and lipid peroxide formation. The levels of catalase were not altered; however, a marginal increase in the levels of glutathione peroxidase was observed. Zingerone significantly enhanced the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione and decreased the levels of corticosterone. Zingerone produced marked improvement in stress induced irritable bowel disorder which could be attributed to the powerful antioxidant nature, direct effect on the intestinal smooth muscle and adaptogenic nature. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Objective Recently, the authors demonstrated altered gene expression in the jejunal mucosa of diarrhoeapredominant irritable bowel syndrome patients (IBS-D); specifically, the authors showed that genes related to mast cells and the intercellular apical junction complex (AJC) were expressed differently than in healthy subjects. The aim of the authors here was to determine whether these alterations are associated with structural abnormalities in AJC and their relationship with mast cell activation and IBS-D clinical manifestations. Design A clinical assessment and a jejunal biopsy were obtained in IBS-D patients (n=45) and healthy subjects (n=30). Mucosal mast cell number and activation were determined by quantifying CD117+ cells/hpf and tryptase expression, respectively. Expression and distribution of AJC specific proteins were evaluated by western blot and confocal microscopy. AJC ultrastructure was assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Results Compared with healthy subjects, IBS-D patients exhibited: (a) increased mast cell counts and activation; (b) increased protein expression of claudin-2, reduced occludin phosphorylation and enhanced redistribution from the membrane to the cytoplasm; and (c) increased myosin kinase expression, reduced myosin phosphatase and, consequently, enhanced phosphorylation of myosin. These molecular alterations were associated with ultrastructural abnormalities at the AJC, specifically, perijunctional cytoskeleton condensation and enlarged apical intercellular distance. Moreover, AJC structural alterations positively correlated both with mast cell activation and clinical symptoms. Conclusion The jejunal mucosa of IBS-D patients displays disrupted apical junctional complex integrity associated with mast cell activation and clinical manifestations. These results provide evidence for the organic nature of IBS-D, a heretofore model disease of functional gastrointestinal disorders.

AB  - Chronic unexplained hypertransaminasemia is an isolated clinical manifestation of celiac disease (CD) and lacks of a clear physiopathological explanation. Since CD and tropical sprue (TS) have similar intestinal functional and histological pattern of injury and that an increased inflammatory response has been reported to occur in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), liver involvement might be expected to occur either in TS or IBS. However, according to author's prior observations, the frequency of hypertransaminasemia is significantly higher in CD than in TS and IBS-diarrhea predominant patients (IBS-D). Thus, based on current knowledge, intestinal mucosal damage, increased intestinal permeability and/or an active intestinal inflammatory response do not completely explain liver damage in CD. We hypothesize that other factors, unique to CD not present in TS or IBS-D, like gluten toxicity and the presence of tissular transglutaminase (tTG) an auto-antigen with pro-inflammatory and remodeling properties, act in addition to intestinal mucosal injury and account to hypertransaminasemia in CD. Further research focusing on the mechanisms of gluten and tTG hepatic toxicity, and/or the characterization of the expression, secretion and enteral-hepatic transport of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines is needed, to understand the possible links between intestinal and liver disorders seen in CD. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) have intestinal hyperpermeability, which contributes to their diarrhea and abdominal pain. MicroRNA 29 (MIR29) regulates intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D. We investigated and searched for targets of MIR29 and investigated the effects of disrupting Mir29 in mice. METHODS: We investigated expression MIR29A and B in intestinal biopsies collected during endoscopy from patients with IBS (n = 183) and without IBS (controls) (n = 36). Levels were correlated with disease phenotype. We also generated and studied Mir29-/- mice, in which expression of Mir29a and b, but not c, is lost. Colitis was induced by administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; intestinal tissues were collected and permeability was assessed. Microarray analysis was performed using tissues from Mir29-/- mice. Changes in levels of target genes were measured in human colonic epithelial cells and small intestinal epithelial cells after knockdown of MIR29 with anti-MIRs. RESULTS: Intestinal tissues from patients with IBS-D (but not IBS with constipation or controls) had increased levels of MIR29A and B, but reduced levels of Claudin-1 (CLDN1) and nuclear factor-κB-repressing factor (NKRF). Induction of colitis and water avoidance stress increased levels of Mir29a and Mir29b and intestinal permeability in wild-type mice; these increased intestinal permeability in colons of far fewer Mir29-/- mice. In microarray and knockdown experiments, MIR29A and B were found to reduce levels of NKRF and CLDN1 messenger RNA, and alter levels of other messenger RNAs that regulate intestinal permeability. CONCLUSIONS: Based on experiments in knockout mice and analyses of intestinal tissue samples from patients with IBS-D, MIR29 targets and reduces expression of CLDN1 and NKRF to increase intestinal permeability. Strategies to block MIR29 might be developed to restore intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D. © 2015 AGA Institute.

AB  - An overlap of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) exists across subtype groups. Symptoms include intestinal gas, diarrhea, dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal pain, and constipation. The unifying symptom may be excessive intestinal gas as a by-product of intestinal microbial fermentation. Abnormal fermentation of food takes place when gut microbes expand proximally into the small intestine instead of being confined predominantly to the colon. Such proximal expansion of indigenous gut microbes or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may lead to activation of host mucosal immunity and an increase in intestinal permeability to result in flu-like extra-intestinal symptoms that accompany the classic IBS symptoms of altered bowels. The presence of methane on lactulose breath testing is associated with constipation-predominant IBS. Antibiotic therapy may be appropriate to treat underlying SIBO in IBS patients. Seventy-five percent improvement of IBS symptoms was reported in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study once antibiotics succeeded in treating bacterial overgrowth. Once a good clinical response and normalization of the lactulose breath test are achieved, a prokinetic agent may be used to stimulate phase III of interdigestive motility to delay relapse of bacterial overgrowth. © 2005 MedReviews, LLC.

AB  - Life stress and mucosal inflammation may influence symptom onset and severity in certain gastrointestinal disorders, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), in connection with dysregulated intestinal barrier. However, the mechanism responsible remains unknown. Crowding is a validated animal model reproducing naturalistic psychosocial stress, whose consequences on gut physiology remain unexplored. Our aims were to prove that crowding stress induces mucosal inflammation and intestinal dysfunction, to characterize dynamics in time, and to evaluate the implication of stress-induced mast cell activation on intestinal dysfunction. Wistar-Kyoto rats were submitted to 15 days of crowding stress (8 rats/cage) or sham-crowding (2 rats/cage). We measured spontaneous and corticotropin-releasing factor-mediated release of plasma corticosterone. Stress-induced intestinal chrono-pathobiology was determined by measuring intestinal inflammation, epithelial damage, mast cell activation and infiltration, and intestinal barrier function. Corticosterone release was higher in crowded rats throughout day 15. Stress-induced mild inflammation, manifested earlier in the ileum and the colon than in the jejunum. While mast cell counts remained mostly unchanged, piecemeal degranulation increased along time, as the mucosal content and luminal release of rat mast cell protease-II. Stress-induced mitochondrial injury and increased jejunal permeability, both events strongly correlated with mast cell activation at day 15. Taken together, we have provided evidences that long-term exposure to psychosocial stress promotes mucosal inflammation and mast cell-mediated barrier dysfunction in the rat bowel. The notable resemblance of these findings with those in some IBS patients, support the potential interest and translational validity of this experimental model for the research of stress-sensitive intestinal disorders, particularly IBS. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES:The objective of this study was to investigate how mast cell tryptase may influence intestinal permeability and tight junction (TJ) proteins in vitro and explore translation to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).METHODS:We investigate. The effect of: (1) tryptase on Caco-2 monolayers, (2) mast cell degranulation in a Caco-2/human mast cell-1 (HMC-1) co-culture model, (3) mast cell degranulation±tryptase inhibition with nafamostat mesilate (NM). Epithelial integrity was assessed by transepithelial resistance (TER), permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The expression of junctional proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), claudin-1 (CLD-1), CLD-2, CLD-3, occludin and E-cadherin was determined by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Based o. The in vitro results, we further assessed JAM-A expression in biopsy tissue (cecum) from 34 IBS patients, 12 controls, and 8 inflammatory controls using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and explored associations between JAM-A and IBS symptoms.RESULTS: ptase disrupted epithelial integrity in Caco-2 monolayers as shown by a significant decrease in TER, an increase in permeability to FITC-dextran, and a decrease i. The expression of junctional proteins JAM-A, CLD-1, and ZO-1 within 24 h. Correspondingly, i. The Caco-2/HMC-1 co-culture model we showed a significant decrease in TER, an increase in permeability to FITC-dextran, an. The presence of open TJs (TEM) in response to mast cell degranulation within 24 h. In this co-culture model, mast cell degranulation significantly decreased JAM-A and CLD-1 protein expression at 24 h. Tryptase inhibition (NM) significantly reduce. The effect of mast cell degranulation o. The junctional protein JAM-A, TER, and FITC-dextran flux. In IBS, epithelial JAM-A protein expression was significantly reduced in IBS tissue compared with controls. Lower JAM-A expression was associated with more severe abdominal pain (r s =-0.69, P=0.018) and longer duration of symptoms (r s =-0.7, P=0.012) in IBS-alternating subtype.CONCLUSIONS:uced JAM-A expression in vitro appears to contribute t. The underlying mechanisms of altered epithelial integrity in response to tryptase released from degranulating mast cells. In IBS, JAM-A expression was significantly reduced i. The cecal epithelium and associated with abdominal pain severity. JAM-A may provide new insights int. The underlying mechanisms in IBS.

AB  - Background An association between atopic disease and gastrointestinal complaints has been suggested. Aim To explore the association between atopic disease, gastrointestinal symptoms, and possible gastrointestinal manifestations of atopic disease in patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity. Methods Symptoms, skin prick tests, serum markers of allergy and intestinal permeability were recorded in 71 adult patients. Eosinophils, tryptase- and IgE-positive cells were counted in duodenal biopsies. Results Sixty-six (93%) patients had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 43 (61%) had atopic disease, predominantly rhinoconjunctivitis. All 43 were sensitized to inhalant allergens, 29 (41%) to food allergens, but food challenges were negative. Serum total IgE and duodenal IgE-positive cell counts were significantly correlated (P < 0.0001) and both were significantly higher in atopic than in non-atopic patients (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.003 respectively). IgE-positive cells appeared to be 'armed' mast cells. Intestinal permeability was significantly elevated in atopic compared with non-atopic patients (P = 0.02). Gastrointestinal symptoms and numbers of tryptase-positive mast cells and eosinophils did not differ between groups. Conclusions Patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity had a high prevalence of IBS and atopic disease. Atopic patients had increased intestinal permeability and density of IgE-bearing cells compared with non-atopic patients, but gastrointestinal symptoms did not differ between groups. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - An essential role of the intestinal epithelium is to separate luminal contents from the interstitium, a function primarily determined by the integrity of the epithelium and the tight junction that seals the paracellular space. Intestinal tight junctions are selectively permeable, and intestinal permeability can be increased physiologically in response to luminal nutrients or pathologically by mucosal immune cells and cytokines, the enteric nervous system, and pathogens. Compromised intestinal barrier function is associated with an array of clinical conditions, both intestinal and systemic. Although most available data are correlative, some studies support a model where cycles of increased intestinal permeability, intestinal immune activation, and subsequent immune-mediated barrier loss contribute to disease progression. This model is applicable to intestinal and systemic diseases. However, it has not been proven, and both mechanistic and therapeutic studies are ongoing. Nevertheless, the correlation between increased intestinal permeability and disease has caught the attention of the public, leading to a rise in popularity of the diagnosis of "leaky gut syndrome," which encompasses a range of systemic disorders. Proponents claim that barrier restoration will cure underlying disease, but this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Moreover, human and mouse studies show that intestinal barrier loss alone is insufficient to initiate disease. It is therefore uncertain whether increased permeability in these patients is a cause or effect of the underlying disorder. Although drug targets that may mediate barrier restoration have been proposed, none have been proven effective. As such, current treatments for barrier dysfunction should target the underlying disease. © 2013 AGA Institute.

AB  - Exposure to stress in early life can have a profound impact on health in later life, including intestinal pathology. Maternal separation is a well-established and reproducible model of early life stress in rodents that leads to the development of mood disorders and altered intestinal function, including visceral hypersensitivity, colonic dysmotility, and increased intestinal permeability. In this article, we highlight the consequences of disruption of normal programming after exposure to maternal separation in neonates: the development of intestinal alterations in both neonatal and adult animals as well as the accompanying behavioral changes. Mechanisms of action include corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), which signal both in the brain and in the periphery. Exposure to stress in early life also can alter bacterial colonization, which is prevented by treatment with probiotic organisms. We conclude by highlighting the link between stress and colonic permeability in humans, including the increased risk of disease relapse in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). © 2009 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Majority of the patients with perceived food hypersensitivity have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and a significant proportion of IBS patients also attribute their gastrointestinal complaints to food items. Different factors such as disturbed intestinal fermentation, enteric dysmotility, post-infectious changes and altered microbial flora in the colon as well as psychological disturbances likely play a role in the pathophysiology and symptoms generation in patients with food hypersensitivity. In addition, a number of studies in these patient groups indicate that local, systemic and mucosal immune systems are activated. The question now is no longer intestinal immune activation, but how the immune system is activated in these patients. In the following review, the potential pathogenetic role of the immune system and evidence of immune activation are reported in patients with perceived food hypersensitivity. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The Leaky Gut Syndrome - impairment of the gut wall functionality - is involved in many inflammatory diseases, among them IBS. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of arabinogalactan (AG) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on gut wall modulation using a Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®) - inoculated with faecal material from an IBS donor - coupled with co-cultures of enterocytes and macrophages (transwell approach using Caco-2 and THP1 cells). AG and FOS showed a different fermentation profile (more proximal for FOS and distal for AG) and both fibres exerted a potential positive effect on gut barrier (increased TEER parameter) and inflammation (modulation of cytokines IL-8, IL-6, IL-10 and NF-κB) in their main area of fermentation. AG could be an interesting nutritional supplement for the treatment of those conditions characterized by inflammation and increased permeability in the distal colon.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating. Interestingly, there is now evidence of the presence of a low-grade inflammatory status in many IBS patients, including histopathological and mucosal cytokine levels in the colon, as well as the presence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The use of a genetically engineered food-grade bacterium, such as Lactococcus lactis, secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been proven by many pre-clinical studies to be a successful therapy to treat colon inflammation. In this study, we first reproduced the recovery-recurrence periods observed in IBS-patients in a new chronic model characterized by 2 episodes of DiNitro-BenzeneSulfonic-acid (DNBS)-challenge and we tested the effects of a recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting IL-10 under a Stress-Inducible Controlled Expression (SICE) system. In vivo gut permeability, colonic serotonin levels, cytokine profiles, and spleen cell populations were then measured as readouts of a low-grade inflammation. In addition, since there is increasing evidence that gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function, tight junction proteins were also measured by qRT-PCR after administration of recombinant L. lactis in DNBS-treated mice. Strikingly, oral administration of L. lactis secreting active IL-10 in mice resulted in significant protective effects in terms of permeability, immune activation, and gut-function parameters. Although genetically engineered bacteria are, for now, used only as a "proof-of-concept," our study validates the interest in the use of the novel SICE system in L. lactis to express therapeutic molecules, such as IL-10, locally at mucosal surfaces. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and change of bowel habits without organic disease. Many patients seek alternative IBS treatments because of the limitations of conventional treatments. Gwakhyangjeonggisan (GJS), a herbal formula, has long been used for alleviating diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) in traditional medicine. Duolac7S, which comprises 7 bacterial species as probiotics, has been frequently used for D-IBS. Although GJS and Duolac7S have been administered simultaneously in many D-IBS patients, no study has investigated the effects of GJS and Duolac7S combination therapy on D-IBS. The current trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 4-arm study. After a 2-week run-in period, 60 patients with D-IBS will be randomly assigned to one of the 4 combination groups consisting of GJS (water extract granules, 3 g/pack, 3 times a day) with Duolac7S (powder form, 1 capsule, 2 times a day) or their placebos and followed up for 2 weeks. The assigned treatments will last for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes are adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort and the proportion of responders (on a weekly basis). The secondary outcomes are visual analog scale for IBS symptoms (on a daily basis), quality of life (at 0, 8, and 10 weeks), intestinal permeability, and composition of intestinal microbiota (at 0 and 8 weeks). The present study is designed to examine the safety and efficacy of GJS and Duolac7S combination therapy on D-IBS. Our study provides the clinical evidence of a new therapeutic strategy for D-IBS.

AB  - Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2011; 33: 1123-1132 Summary Background Recent research suggests that an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota and a dysfunctional intestinal barrier might trigger irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). As probiotics have been reported to restore the intestinal microbiota and the gut barrier, the therapeutic potential of probiotics within IBS became of strong interest. Aim To assess the efficacy of Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 in IBS. Methods A total of 122 patients were randomised to receive either placebo (N = 62) or MIMBb75 (N = 60) once a day for 4 weeks. The severity of IBS symptoms was recorded daily on a 7-point Likert scale. Results MIMBb75 significantly reduced the global assessment of IBS symptoms by -0.88 points (95% CI: -1.07; -0.69) when compared with only -0.16 (95% CI: -0.32; 0.00) points in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). MIMBb75 also significantly improved the IBS symptoms pain/discomfort, distension/bloating, urgency and digestive disorder. The evaluation of the SF12 sum scores showed a significant gain in quality of life within the bifidobacteria group. Furthermore, adequate relief was reported by 47% of the patients in the bifidobacteria and only by 11% of the patients in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Overall responder rates were 57% in the bifidobacteria group but only 21% in the placebo group (P = 0.0001). MIMBb75 was well tolerated and adverse events were not different from placebo. Conclusions Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 effectively alleviates global IBS and improves IBS symptoms simultaneously with an improvement of quality of life. Considering the high efficacy of MIMBb75 in IBS along with the good side-effect profile, MIMBb75 is a promising candidate for IBS therapy. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Objectives:Despite increased prescription of a gluten-free diet for gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease, there is minimal evidence that suggests that gluten is a trigger. The aims of this study were to determine whether gluten ingestion can induce symptoms in non-celiac individuals and to examine the mechanism.Methods:A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was undertaken in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was excluded and who were symptomatically controlled on a gluten-free diet. Participants received either gluten or placebo in the form of two bread slices plus one muffin per day with a gluten-free diet for up to 6 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale and markers of intestinal inflammation, injury, and immune activation were monitored.Results:A total of 34 patients (aged 29-59 years, 4 men) completed the study as per protocol. Overall, 56% had human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8. Adherence to diet and supplements was very high. Of 19 patients (68%) in the gluten group, 13 reported that symptoms were not adequately controlled compared with 6 of 15 (40%) on placebo (P=0.0001; generalized estimating equation). On a visual analog scale, patients were significantly worse with gluten within 1 week for overall symptoms (P=0.047), pain (P=0.016), bloating (P=0.031), satisfaction with stool consistency (P=0.024), and tiredness (P=0.001). Anti-gliadin antibodies were not induced. There were no significant changes in fecal lactoferrin, levels of celiac antibodies, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, or intestinal permeability. There were no differences in any end point in individuals with or without DQ2/DQ8.Conclusions:Non-celiac gluten intolerance may exist, but no clues to the mechanism were elucidated. © 2011 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Aim: To determine the evidence for the effect of gluten ingestion on gastrointestinal symptoms, intestinal permeability and other indices of small intestinal injury in non-coeliac, gluten intolerant individuals. Methods: A literature review was performed searching for interventional studies that addressed the issue. Results: One unblinded study that identified symptomatic response to gluten did not effectively exclude patients with coeliac disease, since many had intraepithelial lymphocytosis. A double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was recently reported in patients in whom coeliac disease had been excluded by either normal duodenal histology on a gluten containing diet, or absence of the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 haplotype (56%). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 16 g/day carbohydrate-free gluten or placebo for six weeks. Participants were enrolled if they had gastrointestinal symptoms that had improved on a GFD and had been on a gluten free diet for at least 6weeks prior to enrolment. 19 received gluten and 15 received placebo. Change between baseline and final weeks were greater for patients receiving gluten in overall symptom severity compared with those receiving placebo (p=0.047). and were worse with gluten within one week for pain (p=0.016), bloating (p=0.031), satisfaction with stool consistency (p=0.024), and tiredness (p=0.001). Mechanisms for symptom induction were not identified. Conclusions: Non-coeliac gluten intolerance does exist. Future studies need to identify issues of the dose of gluten needed and mechanisms of action. © 2011 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Background: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is accompanied by a) systemic IgA/IgM responses against the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of commensal bacteria; b) inflammation, e.g. increased plasma interleukin-(IL)1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α; and c) activation of cell-mediated immunity (CMI), as demonstrated by increased neopterin. Methods: To study the relationships between the IgA/IgM responses to the LPS of microbiota, inflammation, CMI and the symptoms of ME/CFS we measured the IgA/IgM responses to the LPS of 6 different enterobacteria, serum IL-1, TNFα, neopterin, and elastase in 128 patients with ME/CFS and chronic fatigue (CF). Severity of symptoms was assessed by the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (FF) Rating Scale. Results: Serum IL-1, TNFα, neopterin and elastase are significantly higher in patients with ME/CFS than in CF patients. There are significant and positive associations between the IgA responses to LPS and serum IL-1, TNFα, neopterin and elastase. Patients with an abnormally high IgA response show increased serum IL-1, TNFα and neopterin levels, and higher ratings on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) than subjects with a normal IgA response. Serum IL-1, TNFα and neopterin are significantly related to fatigue, a flu-like malaise, autonomic symptoms, neurocognitive disorders, sadness and irritability. Conclusions: The findings show that increased IgA responses to commensal bacteria in ME/CFS are associated with inflammation and CMI activation, which are associated with symptom severity. It is concluded that increased translocation of commensal bacteria may be responsible for the disease activity in some ME/CFS patients. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Results Microbiota analysis revealed a bacterial profile of 27 genus-like groups, providing an Index of Microbial Dysbiosis (IMD), which significantly separated patient groups and controls. Within this profile, several members of Bacteroidetes phylum were increased 12-fold in patients, while healthy controls had 35-fold more uncultured Clostridia. We showed correlations between the IMD and expression of several host gene pathways, including amino acid synthesis, cell junction integrity and inflammatory response, suggesting an impaired epithelial barrier function in IBS.; Background About 10% of patients with IBS report the start of the syndrome after infectious enteritis. The clinical features of postinfectious IBS (PI-IBS) resemble those of diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). While altered faecal microbiota has been identified in other IBS subtypes, composition of the microbiota in patients with PI-IBS remains uncharacterised.; Objective To characterise the microbial composition of patients with PI-IBS, and to examine the associations between the faecal microbiota and a patient's clinical features.; Design Using a phylogenetic microarray and selected qPCR assays, we analysed differences in the faecal microbiota of 57 subjects from five study groups: patients with diagnosed PI-IBS, patients who 6 months after gastroenteritis had either persisting bowel dysfunction or no IBS symptoms, benchmarked against patients with IBS-D and healthy controls. In addition, the associations between the faecal microbiota and health were investigated by correlating the microbial profiles to immunological markers, quality of life indicators and host gene expression in rectal biopsies.; Conclusions The faecal microbiota of patients with PI-IBS differs from that of healthy controls and resembles that of patients with IBS-D, suggesting a common pathophysiology. Moreover, our analysis suggests a variety of host-microbe associations that may underlie intestinal symptoms, initiated by gastroenteritis.

AB  - Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) and mast cell (MC) mediators contribute to inflammatory and functional gastrointestinal disorders. We aimed to characterize jejunal PAR-2-mediated responses and the potential MC involvement in the early and late phases of a rat model of postinfectious gut dysfunction. Jejunal tissues of control and Trichinella spiralis-infected (14 and 30 days postinfection) rats, treated or not with the MC stabilizer, ketotifen, were used. Histopathology and immunostaining were used to characterize inflammation, PAR-2 expression, and mucosal and connective tissue MCs. Epithelial barrier function (hydroelectrolytic transport and permeability) and motility were assessed in vitro in basal conditions and after PAR-2 activation. Intestinal inflammation on day 14 postinfection (early phase) was significantly resolved by day 30 (late phase) although MC counts and epithelial permeability remained increased. PAR-2-mediated ion transport (Ussing chambers, in vitro) and epithelial surface PAR-2 expression were reduced in the early phase, with a trend toward normalization during the late phase. In control conditions, PAR-2 activation (organ bath) induced biphasic motor responses (relaxation followed by excitation). At 14 days postinfection, spontaneous contractility and PAR-2-mediated relaxations were enhanced; motor responses were normalized on day 30. Postinfectious changes in PAR-2 functions were not affected by ketotifen treatment. We concluded that, in the rat model of Trichinella spiralis infection, alterations of intestinal PAR-2 function and expression depend on the inflammatory phase considered. A lack of a ketotifen effect suggests no interplay between MCs and PAR-2-mediated motility and ion transport alterations. These observations question the role of MC mediators in PAR-2-modulating postinfectious gut dysfunction. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background: Growing evidence suggests that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have increased intestinal permeability. In addition, mucosal soluble mediators are involved in the pathophysiology of pain in IBS. We aimed to investigate (1) paracellular permeability in colonic biopsies of patients with IBS; and (2) the ability of soluble factors from colonic biopsies to reproduce these alterations in vitro. Methods: Paracellular permeability in colonic biopsies of healthy subjects and patients with IBS was measured by mounting the biopsies in Ussing chambers. Cleared supernatant (SUP) of the culture from colonic biopsies was collected and applied to Caco-2 cells for 48 h. Paracellular permeability and transepithelial resistance (TER) were evaluated. mRNA expression of the tight junction proteins, zonula occludens (Z0)-1 and occludin, was assessed in colonic biopsies. Abdominal pain was assessed using a validated questionnaire. Results: Permeability of colonic biopsies was significantly higher in patients with IBS compared to healthy subjects. These changes were associated with significantly lower expression of ZO-1 mRNA in biopsies of IBS as compared to healthy subjects. Compared to healthy subjects, SUP of IBS markedly reduced TER and significantly increased permeability in Caco-2 cells. SUP of IBS patients induced a significant decrease of ZO-1 mRNA in Caco-2 as compared to healthy subjects. SUP-induced increased paracellular permeability correlated with the severity of abdominal pain. Conclusions: Our study shows that colonic soluble mediators are able to reproduce functional (permeability) and molecular (ZO-1 mRNA expression) alterations observed in IBS patients. These findings might pave the way both to identify novel biomarkers as well as new therapeutic targets in IBS.

AB  - Background: A valid biomarker is 'an indicator of normal biologic or pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention'. There is no validated biomarker for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the study was to assess ability of three quantitative traits to identify treatable processes to discriminate between IBS-diarrhea (IBS-D) patients, IBS-constipation (IBS-C) patients and healthy volunteers (HV). Methods: In 30 HV, 30 IBS-C patients and 64 IBS-D patients, we characterized bowel symptoms and quantitated pathophysiological mechanisms: bile acid (BA) synthesis (serum C4 and FGF19), fecal BA and fat, colonic transit (CT), and intestinal permeability (IP). We used multiple logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROCAUC) to appraise three factors (fecal BA, CT, and IP) individually and in combination to identify discriminant targets for treatment in IBS. Key Results: There were significant associations between the three subgroups and symptoms reflecting bowel function and the quantitative traits. There were significant associations between fecal BA and CT at 48 h (r = 0.43; p < 0.001) and between fecal BA and IP (r = 0.23; p = 0.015). Individually, fecal BA and CT48 (but not IP) were significant independent predictors for distinguishing HV from IBS. In combination, they discriminated HV from IBS-D patients (ROCAUC 0.70), HV from IBS-C patients (ROCAUC 0.73), and IBS-C patients from IBS-D patients (ROCAUC 0.86). Colonic transit and fecal BA excretion together discriminate between healthy volunteers and IBS-C patients or IBS-D patients, or between the IBS subgroups with 75-90% specificity at 60% sensitivity. Conclusions & Inferences: Colonic transit and fecal BA individually and together constitute useful biomarkers to identify treatable mechanisms in IBS and to differentiate subgroups of IBS. We assessed the ability of three quantitative traits to identify treatable processes to discriminate between IBS-D patients, IBS-C patients, and healthy volunteers. Colonic transit and fecal BA individually and together constitute useful biomarkers to identify treatable mechanisms in IBS and to differentiate subgroups of IBS. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The pathobiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is multifaceted. We aimed to identify candidate genes predisposing to quantitative traits in IBS. In 30 healthy volunteers, 30 IBS-constipation, and 64 IBS-diarrhea patients, we measured bowel symptoms, bile acid (BA) synthesis (serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and FGF19), fecal BA and fat, colonic transit (CT by scintigraphy), and intestinal permeability (IP by 2-sugar excretion). We assessed associations of candidate genes controlling BA metabolism (KLB rs17618244 and FGFR4 rs351855), BA receptor (GPBAR1 rs11554825), serotonin (5-HT) reuptake (SLC6A4 through rs4795541 which encodes for the 44-bp insert in 5HTTLPR), or immune activation (TNFSF15 rs4263839) with three primary quantitative traits of interest: colonic transit, BA synthesis, and fecal BA excretion. There were significant associations between fecal BA and CT at 48 h (r = 0.43; P < 0.001) and IP (r = 0.23; P = 0.015). GPBAR1 genotype was associated with CT48 (P = 0.003) and total fecal BA [P = 0.030, false detection rate (FDR) P = 0.033]. Faster CT48 observed with both CC and TT GPBAR1 genotypes was due to significant interaction with G allele of KLB, which increases BA synthesis and excretion. Other univariate associations (P < 0.05, without FDR correction) observed between GPBAR1 and symptom phenotype and gas sensation ratings support the role of GPBAR1 receptor. Associations between SLC6A4 and stool consistency, ease of passage, postprandial colonic tone, and total fecal BA excretion provide data in support of future hypothesis-testing studies. Genetic control of GPBAR1 receptor predisposing to pathobiological mechanisms in IBS provides evidence from humans in support of the importance of GPBAR1 to colonic motor and secretory functions demonstrated in animal studies. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - According to epidemiological studies, twice as many women as men are affected by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in western countries, suggesting a role for sex hormones in IBS pathophysiology. Despite growing evidence about the implications of sex hormones in IBS symptom modulation, data on mechanisms by which they influence disease development are sparse. This review aims to determine the state of knowledge about the role of sex hormones in sensorimotor dysfunctions and to address the possible interplay of sex hormones with common risk factors associated with IBS. The scientific bibliography was searched using the following keywords: irritable bowel syndrome, sex, gender, ovarian hormone, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, symptoms, pain, sensitivity, motility, permeability, stress, immune system, brain activity, spinal, supraspinal, imaging. Ovarian hormones variations along the menstrual cycle affect sensorimotor gastrointestinal function in both healthy and IBS populations. They can modulate pain processing by interacting with neuromodulator systems and the emotional system responsible for visceral pain perception. These hormones can also modulate the susceptibility to stress, which is a pivotal factor in IBS occurrence and symptom severity. For instance, estrogen-dependent hyper-responsiveness to stress can promote immune activation or impairments of gut barrier function. In conclusion, whereas it is important to keep in mind that ovarian hormones cannot be considered as a causal factor of IBS, they arguably modulate IBS onset and symptomatology. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited and studies assessing the link between IBS symptoms and ovarian hormone levels are needed to improve our knowledge of the disease evolution with regard to gender. Further studies assessing the role of male hormones are also needed to understand fully the role of sex hormones in IBS. Finally, investigation of brain-gut interactions is critical to decipher how stress, ovarian hormones, and female brain processing of pain can translate into gut dysfunctions. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

AB  - Background/Aims: Defective epithelial barrier has been implicated in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate gut permeability in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis (UC) and in patients with IBS. Methods: IBS patients of the diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) and of the constipation-predominant subgroup (IBS-C), patients with inactive UC and healthy subjects were enrolled. Gut permeability was evaluated by measuring 24-hour urine excretion of orally administered 51Cr-EDTA. Clinical symptoms were evaluated in IBS-D patients and correlated to colonic permeability. Results: There was a significant decrease in the proximal small intestinal permeability in IBS-C patients compared to controls (0.26 ± 0.05 vs. 0.63 ± 0.1%; p < 0.05). Distal small intestinal permeability showed no significant difference in the studied group of patients compared to controls. Colonic permeability of IBS-D and inactive UC patients was significantly increased compared to controls (2.68 ± 0.35 and 3.74 ± 0.49 vs. 1.04 ± 0.18%; p < 0.05, p < 0.001). Colonic permeability of IBS-D patients correlated with stool frequency. Conclusions: Elevated gut permeability is localized to the colon both in IBS-D and in inactive UC patients. © 2011 S.

AB  - The present study investigates the intestinal permeability of otilonium bromide, a spasmolytic drug used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, across Caco-2 cell monolayers. The amount of otilonium bromide transported was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Epithelial barrier integrity was estimated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and the transport of reference compounds, P-glycoprotein activity by measuring rhodamine 123 efflux. Results showed that the apparent permeability of otilonium bromide was comparable to that of our zero permeability marker, inulin, in the apical-to-basal direction and similar to that of rhodamine 123 in the basal-to-apical direction. The P-glycoprotein substrate, verapamil, prevented otilonium bromide efflux and, conversely, otilonium bromide inhibited P-glycoprotein activity. Bile salts induced a transient opening of tight junctions, as measured by selective increase of paracellular transport, and significantly enhanced the absorption of otilonium bromide. In turn otilonium bromide potentiates the effect of bile salts on tight junctions without modifying their critical micellar concentration or altering cell viability. In conclusion, otilonium bromide is a paracellularly transported drug whose absorption, in amounts sufficient to exert a spasmolytic effect, is favoured by bile salts. P-glycoprotein, by stimulating efflux, contributes to remove excess compound, restraining its distribution and site of action to the intestinal wall. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.

AB  - The pathophysiological mechanisms of the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are poorly understood and it is unlikely that a single entity is responsible for the various presentations of this heterogeneous disorder. There are peripheral mechanisms with impaired intestinal motility, parietal abnormalities (micro-inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, abnormal mucosal immunity), intraluminal factors (abnormal microbiota, diet, bile acids) and central mechanisms with the role of visceral hypersensitivity, abnormal mechanisms of pain control, and psychosocial factors. © 2013 Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - Background & Aims: Acute gastroenteritis is the strongest risk factor for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In May 2000, >2300 residents of Walkerton, Ontario, developed gastroenteritis from microbial contamination of the municipal water supply; a longitudinal study found that >36.2% of these developed IBS. We used this cohort to study genetic susceptibility to post-infectious (PI)-IBS. Methods: We screened 79 functional variants of genes with products involved in serotoninergic pathways, intestinal epithelial barrier function, and innate immunity and performed fine mapping in regions of interest. We compared data from Walkerton residents who developed gastroenteritis and reported PI-IBS 2 to 3 years after the outbreak (n = 228, cases) with data from residents who developed gastroenteritis but did not develop PI-IBS (n = 581, controls). Results: Four variants were associated with PI-IBS, although the association was not significant after correction for the total number of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Two were located in TLR9, which encodes a pattern recognition receptor (rs352139, P545P; P = .0059 and rs5743836, -T1237C; P = .0250; r2 < 0.14); 1 was in CDH1, which encodes a tight junction protein (rs16260, -C160A; P = .0352); and 1 was in IL6, which encodes a cytokine (rs1800795, -G174C; P = .0420). Denser mapping of these 3 regions revealed 1 novel association in IL6 (rs2069861; P = .0069) and 14 associations that could be accounted for by linkage disequilibrium with the 4 original variants. The TLR9, IL6, and CDH1 variants all persisted as independent risk factors for PI-IBS when controlling for previously identified clinical risk factors. Conclusion: This is the first descriptive study to assess potential genetic determinants of PI-IBS. Genes that encode proteins involved in epithelial cell barrier function and the innate immune response to enteric bacteria are associated with development of IBS following acute gastroenteritis. © 2010 AGA Institute.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders and, for some sufferers, results in significant impairment in quality of life. From the outset, IBS was regarded as a disorder of gastrointestinal motility, and terms such as 'spastic colon' or even 'spastic colitis' applied. As these terms imply, the focus in the early days of the investigation of the pathophysiology of IBS was on the colon and on the left colon, in particular. Subsequently, as advances in manometric technology permitted reliable recordings of motor activity from the small intestine, alterations in small intestinal motility were described in IBS, at rest, following food ingestion and in response to stressful stimuli; some of the abnormal patterns identified seemed to correlate temporally with certain symptoms. More recently, interest in the potential roles of such phenomena as dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation and enhanced intestinal permeability have renewed interest in the potential role of the small intestine and its neuromuscular apparatus in IBS. Relationships between small intestinal dysmotility and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) are more clear-cut given that impaired gut motor activity is one of the primary factors that predisposes to SIBO. Dysmotility is, indeed, the process underlying the development of SIBO in relation to conditions as diverse as scleroderma, diabetes, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, sometimes debilitating, gastrointestinal disorder worldwide. While altered gut motility and sensation, as well as aberrant brain perception of visceral events, are thought to contribute to the genesis of symptoms in IBS, a search for an underlying aetiology has, to date, proven unsuccessful. Recently, attention has been focused on the microbiota as a possible factor in the pathogenesis of IBS. Prompted by a number of clinical observations, such as the recognition of the de novo development of IBS following enteric infections, as well as descriptions of changes in colonic bacterial populations in IBS and supported by clinical responses to interventions, such as antibiotics and probiotics, that modify the microbiota, various approaches have been taken to investigating the microbiota-host response in IBS, as well as in animal models thereof. From such studies a considerable body of evidence has accumulated to indicate the activation or upregulation of both factors involved in bacterial engagement with the host as well host defence mechanisms against bacteria. Alterations in gut barrier function, occurring in response, or in parallel, to changes in the microbiota, have also been widely described and can be seen to play a pivotal role in generating and sustaining host immune responses both within and beyond the gut. In this manner a plausible hypothesis, based on an altered microbiota and/or an aberrant host response, for the pathogenesis, of at least some instances of IBS, can be generated. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the effect of the probiotic combination Lactibiane Tolerance® (LT) on epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo Methods: The effect of the multispecies probiotic LT was assessed on several models of epithelial barrier function both in vitro (in basal and inflammatory conditions) and in vivo [visceral hypersensitivity induced by chronic stress or by colonic perfusion of a fecal supernatant (FSN) from patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)]. In vitro, we measured the permeability of confluent T84 cell monolayers incubated with or without LT by evaluating the paracellular flux of macromolecules, in basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or with conditioned medium of colonic biopsies from IBS patients (IBS-CM). In vivo, male C57/Bl6 mice received orally NaCl or LT for 15 d and were submitted to water avoidance stress (WAS) before evaluating visceral sensitivity by measuring the myoelectrical activity of the abdominal muscle and the paracellular permeability with 51Cr-EDTA. Permeability and sensitivity were also measured after colonic instillation of FSN. Tight-junctions were assessed by immunoblotting and TLR-4 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry Results: Incubation of T84 cell monolayers with LT in basal conditions had no significant effect on permeability (P > 0.05 vs culture medium). By contrast, addition of LT bacterial bodies (LT) completely prevented the LPS-induced increase in paracellular permeability (P < 0.01 vs LPS 10 ng/mL (LPS 10); P < 0.01 vs LPS 100 ng/mL (LPS 100), P > 0.05 vs culture medium). The effect was dose dependent as addition of 109 LT bacterial bodies induced a stronger decrease in absorbance than 106 LT (109 LT + LPS 10: -20.1% ± 13.4, P < 0.01 vs LPS 10; 106 LT + LPS 10: -11.6% ± 6.2, P < 0.01 vs LPS 10; 109 LT + LPS 100: -14.4% ± 5.5, P < 0.01 vs LPS 100; 106 LT + LPS 100: -11.6% ± 7.3, P < 0.05 vs LPS 100). Moreover, the increase in paracellular permeability induced by culturing T84 cells with conditioned medium of colonic biopsies from IBS patients (IBS-CM) was completely inhibited in the presence of 109 LT (P< 0.01 vs IBS-CM). LT also significantly prevented the epithelial disruption induced by intracolonic infusion of fecal supernatant from IBS patients (P < 0.01 vs IBS FSN) or water avoidance stress P < 0.01 vs WAS) in C57/Bl6 mice and increased the expression of occludin in vitro and in vivo, as assessed by immnunoblotting. The WAS-induced effect on visceral sensitivity was prevented by LT treatment since values obtained for all steps of colorectal distension were significantly (P < 0.01) different from the WAS group. Finally, LT downregulated the response mediated through TLR-4 in vitro (decrease in tumor necrosis factor α secretion in response to LPS: -65.8% for 109 LT and -52.5% for 106 LT, P < 0.01 vs LPS) and in vivo (inhibition of WAS induced an increase in TLR-4 expression in the LT treated mice colon, P < 0.01 vs WAS). Conclusion: The probiotic LT mix prevented the disruption to the epithelial barrier induced by LPS, stress or colonic soluble factors from IBS patients and prevented visceral hypersensitivity. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

AB  - Background and Aims Patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) appear to have increased intestinal permeability; it has been suggested that activation of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) receptors is responsible for this alteration. The aims of this study are to evaluate (1) if rectal (large bowel) permeability is increased in IBS-D and (2) if tryptase plays a critical role in the altered permeability. Methods Rectal biopsies from 20 patients with IBS-D and 30 subjects without the condition (normal controls) were assessed for macromolecular permeability using horseradish peroxidase in Ussing chambers in the basal state and after addition of drugs to the basolateral side. Reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using colonic biopsy tissues from patients with IBS-D and normal subjects. Results When tryptase was added to the basolateral (not mucosal) side of normal rectal biopsy tissues, permeability appeared to be proportional to the increase in tryptase concentration (P ≤ 0.05) and was abolished by the addition of tryptase inhibitor (100 μM nafamostat; 1.568 ± 0.874 ng/2 h/mm2 to 0.766 ± 0.661 ng/2 h/mm2, n = 14, respectively, P ≤ 0.01). Intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D was significantly increased compared with controls (0.848 ± 0.0.600 ng/2 h/mm2, n = 21, P ≤ 0.01). Nafamostat significantly reduced the enhanced permeability in IBS-D (0.934 ± 0.589 ng/2 h/mm2 to 0.247 ± 0.263 ng/ 2 h/mm2, n = 14, respectively, P ≤ 0.05). Transcription levels of PAR2 measured by RT-PCR did not differ between IBS-D and normal subjects. Conclusion Tryptase seems to play an important role in the control of human colonic mucosal permeability, and enhanced tryptase activity was responsible for the increased permeability of rectal mucosa in IBS patients. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - Background: As the accuracy of the "Sugar Test" is currently debated, this study was conducted to focus on how urine volumes may impact the test results. Methods: Fifty-five subjects, 23 healthy and 32 with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), were enrolled. Lactulose and D-mannitol dissolved in water were administered to all the participating subjects; the urine excreted was collected and the total urine volume was measured. The urine samples were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The results were expressed as percentage of urine recovery of lactulose and D-mannitol and lactulose/D-mannitol ratio (LMR). Results: All subjects were divided into two groups: subjects with urine volume <500 mL and subjects with urine volume ≥500 mL. Urine analysis showed that the mean LMR was significantly lower in subjects with urine volume ≥500 mL than in subjects with urine volume <500 mL (0.02 ± 0.02 vs 0.04 ± 0.04; p <0.05). A significant increase in D-mannitol recovery was found to be associated with greater urine volumes (p <0.001). Conclusions: The urine volume may influence urinary excretion of sugar probes. Intake of liquids should therefore be carefully monitored before and during the test and the volume of urine produced over the period of collection should be precisely measured.

AB  - Nutrition plays a key role in patients with celiac disease. Gluten-free diet is main therapeutic option despite of new possibilities keeping the intestinal barrier, modulation of gut microbiome or extraction of gluten from the diet. The prevention of formation the autoimmune reaction against gluten in genetically predisposed patients is the addition of small amount of gluten-rich food during breastfeeding between 4th and 7th months of life. The possible prevention at a later age could include the keeping of gluten-free diet during stress-induced damage of intestinal barrier and/or the influence of gut microbiom using probiotics.Gluten-free diet become to be new phenomenon, new strategy for non-celiac population despite of absency of proven benefits for them. There are defined new clinical entities of gluten intolerance, especially non-celiac gluten sensitivity, but its differentiation from irritable bowel syndrome is very difficult. This issue will require further research. © Science and Education Publishing.

AB  - Background/Aim: Subjective food hypersensitivity is prevalent in the general population. The aim of this study was to seek objective evidence of food hypersensitivity by analyzing intestinal permeability and inflammation markers in gut lavage fluid. Methods: Fifty-two patients with abdominal complaints self-attributed to food hypersensitivity were examined by skin prick test, serum IgE analysis, double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), and intestinal lavage. The results were compared with those of 44 patients without food hypersensitivity. Neither the patients nor the controls had organic diseases that could explain their symptoms. Intestinal lavage was performed by administering 2 liters of isotonic polyethylene glycol (molecular weight 3,350 daltons) solution containing 50 μCi of [51Cr]EDTA through a nasoduodenal tube. The first clear fluid passed per rectum was collected and analyzed for histamine, eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), tryptase, and calprotectin. The intestinal permeability was assessed by determining the 5-hour urinary excretion of [51Cr]EDTA. Calprotectin was also analyzed in native faecal samples. Results: The ECP concentration in gut lavage fluid was significantly higher in the patients than in the controls (p = 0.007), but the overlap between groups was large. Food hypersensitivity was confirmed by positive DBPCFC in only 4 patients. On average, histamine and ECP concentrations were high in these patients. Tryptase, intestinal permeability, and faecal and lavage calprotectin levels were normal. Conclusions: Very few patients had objective evidence of food hypersensitivity. Analyzing intestinal permeability and inflammation markers in gut lavage fluid did not contribute to the diagnosis, but further studies on histamine and ECP are warranted. Copyright © 2004 S.

AB  - Background: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder whose pathogenesis is not completely understood. Its high prevalence and the considerable effects on quality of life make IBS a disease with high social cost. Recent studies suggest that low grade mucosal immune activation, increased intestinal permeability and the altered host-microbiota interactions that modulate innate immune response, contribute to the pathophysiology of IBS. However, the understanding of the precise molecular pathophysiology remains largely unknown. Methodology and Findings: In this study our objective was to evaluate the TLR expression as a key player in the innate immune response, in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients classified into the three main subtypes (with constipation, with diarrhea or mixed). TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression was assessed by real time RT-PCR while TLRs protein expression in intestinal epithelial cells was specifically assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Mucosal inflammatory cytokine production was investigated by the multiplex technology. Here we report that the IBS-Mixed subgroup displayed a significant up-regulation of TLR2 and TLR4 in the colonic mucosa. Furthermore, these expressions were localized in the epithelial cells, opening new perspectives for a potential role of epithelial cells in host-immune interactions in IBS. In addition, the increased TLR expression in IBS-M patients elicited intracellular signaling pathways resulting in increased expression of the mucosal proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL1β. Conclusions: Our results provide the first evidence of differential expression of TLR in IBS patients according to the disease subtype. These results offer further support that microflora plays a central role in the complex pathophysiology of IBS providing novel pharmacological targets for this chronic gastrointestinal disorder according to bowel habits. © 2012 Belmonte et al.

AB  - Objectives: To determine gastrointestinal (GI) permeability and fecal calprotectin concentration in children 7 to 10 years of age with functional abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome (FAP/IBS) versus control subjects and ascertain potential relationships with pain symptoms and stooling. Study design: GI permeability and fecal calprotectin concentration were measured. Children kept a 2-week diary of pain episodes and stooling pattern. Results: Proximal GI permeability was greater in the FAP/IBS group (n = 93) compared with control subjects (n = 52) (0.59 ± 0.50 vs 0.36 ± 0.26, respectively; mean ± SD; P < .001) as was colonic permeability (1.01 ± 0.67 vs 0.81 ± 0.43, respectively; P < .05). Gastric and small intestinal permeability were similar. Fecal calprotectin concentration was greater in children with FAP/IBS compared with control children (65.5 ± 75.4 μg/g stool vs 43.2 ± 39.4, respectively; P < .01). Fecal calprotectin concentration correlated with pain interference with activities (P = .01, r2 = 0.36). There was no correlation between GI permeability and pain related symptoms. Neither permeability nor fecal calprotectin correlated with stool form. Conclusions: Children with FAP/IBS have evidence of increased GI permeability and low-grade GI inflammation, with the latter relating to the degree to which pain interferes with activities. © 2008 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Background: Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome is a common clinical phenomenon of uncertain aetiology. Aim: To test the association between intestinal permeability and irritable bowel syndrome symptoms 2 years after a large waterborne outbreak of bacterial gastroenteritis. Methods: Consecutive adults with Rome I irritable bowel syndrome and controls without irritable bowel syndrome attending a community clinic were enrolled. Intestinal permeability was measured as the ratio of fractional urinary excretions of lactulose and mannitol, and compared among cases vs. controls and predictors of abnormal intestinal permeability were assessed. Results: A total of 218 subjects (132 irritable bowel syndrome cases and 86 non-irritable bowel syndrome controls) completed the study protocol. About 27 (12%) had been diagnosed with the irritable bowel syndrome before the outbreak and 115 (53%) had been ill during the outbreak. Lactulose-mannitol ratios were increased among cases vs. controls (Mann-Whitney mean rank 118.8 vs. 95.3, P = 0.007), and cases were more likely to have a ratio >0.020 (P = 0.007). Among cases, those with increased intestinal permeability were more likely to report increased stool frequency. Both irritable bowel syndrome symptoms and male gender, but not diarrhoeal illness during the outbreak, were significant predictors of abnormal permeability. Conclusions: Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are associated with a subtle increase in intestinal permeability irrespective of prior gastroenteritis. This may improve understanding of the aetiology of both sporadic and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - Background: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) seen by a gastroenterologist often utilize medications that may alter intestinal homeostasis. The question arises whether exposure to these drugs is associated with the development of IBS symptoms. Aim of this study was therefore to assess the use of PPIs and NSAIDs in patients with IBS versus controls.Methods: Cases of IBS from the last 5 years were reviewed. All patients having had at least one prescription for a particular drug (PPIs, NSAIDs, SSRIs, diuretics, ACE inhibitors) in the 6 months prior to the time of initial symptom onset were considered exposed. The control group consisted of individuals randomly selected from the general population.Results: 287 cases of IBS were retrieved for analysis together with 287 age and sex-matched controls. Exposure to PPIs and NSAIDs was significantly higher in IBS patients, whereas no association between ACE inhibitor use and IBS was found. PPIs were not significantly associated when excluding patients with gastrointestinal reflux disease or functional dyspepsia. Exposure to SSRIs was also positively associated with IBS, but only when patients with psychiatric comorbidity were included in the analyses.Conclusions: Medications that may alter intestinal homeostasis such as NSAIDs and PPIs were more frequently used in IBS patients compared to controls. This association might be relevant for everyday clinical practice, but it is remains to be elucidated whether this association is of etiological nature. © 2012 Keszthelyi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Increased intestinal permeability and altered expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins may be implicated in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study aimed to investigate the expression of adherens junction (AJ) protein E-cadherin and TJ proteins zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and claudin (CLD)-1 and associations with IBS symptoms. Methods: Junctional proteins were immunostained in cecal biopsy tissue of Rome II IBS patients (n = 34) comprising both alternating (IBS-A) and diarrhea predominant (IBS-D) subtypes, and controls (n = 12). IBS symptom duration, abdominal pain severity and stool frequency were assessed for IBS patients. Protein expression was determined by immunofluorescence. Key Results: E-cadherin and ZO-1 protein expression was significantly lower (p = 0.03 and p = 0.016, respectively) in the cecal surface epithelium of the IBS group comprising both IBS-A and IBS-D subtypes. CLD-1 expression was not significantly altered compared with controls. On subtype analysis, ZO-1 expression was significantly reduced in both IBS-A and IBS-D compared with controls, whereas E-cadherin was reduced only in IBS-A. Lower E-cadherin expression was associated with longer symptoms duration specifically in IBS-A patients (rs = -0.76, p = 0.004). Reduced E-cadherin associated with abdominal pain severity in the overall IBS group (rs = -0.36, p = 0.041), but this association was unrelated to IBS subtype. Conclusions & Inferences: E-cadherin protein expression in the cecum was significantly lower in IBS-A compared with controls and associated with longstanding symptoms. E-cadherin was further associated with abdominal pain severity in the IBS group overall, but unrelated to IBS subtype. Altered E-cadherin expression may provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS. In this study, comprising IBS-A and IBS-D subtypes, E-cadherin and ZO-1 protein expression was significantly lower in the cecal surface epithelium compared with controls. Furthermore, reduced E-cadherin expressed in the IBS group was associated with more severe abdominal pain, and in IBS-A with longer duration of symptoms. Altered E-cadherin expression may provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that migraine may be associated with gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel syndrome and celiac disease. Here an overview of the associations between migraine and gastrointestinal disorders is presented, as well as possible mechanistic links and clinical implications. People who regularly experience gastrointestinal symptoms have a higher prevalence of headaches, with a stronger association with increasing headache frequency. Children with a mother with a history of migraine are more likely to have infantile colic. Children with migraine are more likely to have experienced infantile colic compared to controls. Several studies demonstrated significant associations between migraine and celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Possible underlying mechanisms of migraine and gastrointestinal diseases could be increased gut permeability and inflammation. Therefore it would be worthwhile to investigate these mechanisms further in migraine patients. These mechanisms also give a rationale to investigate the effects of the use of pre- and probiotics in migraine patients. © 2014 Van_hemert, Breedveld, Rovers, Vermeiden, Witteman, Smits and De_roos.

AB  - Background & Aims Rifaximin is used to treat patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders, but little is known about its therapeutic mechanism. We propose that rifaximin modulates the ileal bacterial community, reduces subclinical inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, and improves gut barrier function to reduce visceral hypersensitivity. Methods We induced visceral hyperalgesia in rats, via chronic water avoidance or repeat restraint stressors, and investigated whether rifaximin altered the gut microbiota, prevented intestinal inflammation, and improved gut barrier function. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 454 pyrosequencing were used to analyze bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA in ileal contents from the rats. Reverse transcription, immunoblot, and histologic analyses were used to evaluate levels of cytokines, the tight junction protein occludin, and mucosal inflammation, respectively. Intestinal permeability and rectal sensitivity were measured. Results Water avoidance and repeat restraint stress each led to visceral hyperalgesia, accompanied by mucosal inflammation and impaired mucosal barrier function. Oral rifaximin altered the composition of bacterial communities in the ileum (Lactobacillus species became the most abundant) and prevented mucosal inflammation, impairment to intestinal barrier function, and visceral hyperalgesia in response to chronic stress. Neomycin also changed the composition of the ileal bacterial community (Proteobacteria became the most abundant species). Neomycin did not prevent intestinal inflammation or induction of visceral hyperalgesia induced by water avoidance stress. Conclusions Rifaximin alters the bacterial population in the ileum of rats, leading to a relative abundance of Lactobacillus. These changes prevent intestinal abnormalities and visceral hyperalgesia in response to chronic psychological stress. © 2014 by the AGA Institute.

AB  - Background and Aim: Alternative and complementary medical practitioners have long advocated alternative treatments for irritable bowel syndrome. A more recent development has been the use of alternative investigations by these practitioners and, in the era of internet advertising, directly by patients themselves. The aim of the present study was to examine the alternative investigations that are advocated for the assessment of gastrointestinal disease and that are available through mainstream laboratories in Australia. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was undertaken for each investigation, which was then evaluated on the basis of ACCE criteria for diagnostic tests. The ACCE criteria consider the analytical and clinical validity, clinical utility and ethical implications of the test. Results: Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) to food antigens, salivary IgA, intestinal permeability, fecal short-chain fatty acids and fecal microbial analysis were identified as readily available. None of the investigations satisfied the ACCE criteria. The tests were deficient in one or more areas of analytical validity, clinical application, validity and ethical usage standards. Conclusion: Alternative investigations lack reliability and direct clinical applications, and should not be recommended for the investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms. © 2012 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence that Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is accompanied by gastro-intestinal symptoms; and IgA and IgM responses directed against lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of commensal bacteria, indicating bacterial translocation. METHODS: This study was carried out to examine gastro-intestinal symptoms in subjects with ME/CFS versus those with chronic fatigue (CF). The two groups were dissected by dichotomizing those fulfilling and not fulfilling Fukudas critera. In these groups, we examined the association between gastro-intestinal symptoms and the IgA and IgM responses directed against commensal bacteria. RESULTS: Using cluster analysis performed on gastro-intestinal symptoms we delineated that the cluster analysis-generated diagnosis of abdominal discomfort syndrome (ADS) was significantly higher in subjects with ME/CFS (59.6%) than in those with CF (17.7%). The diagnosis of ADS was strongly associated with the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There is evidence that ME/CFS consists of two subgroups, i.e. ME/CFS with and without ADS. Factor analysis showed four factors, i.e. 1) inflammation-hyperalgesia; 2) fatigue-malaise; 3) gastro-intestinal symptoms/ADS; and 4) neurocognitive symptoms. The IgA and IgM responses to LPS of commensal bacteria were significantly higher in ME/CFS patients with ADS than in those without ADS. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that ADS is a characteristic of a subset of patients with ME/CFS and that increased bacterial translocation (leaky gut) is associated with ADS symptoms. This study has defined a pathway phenotype, i.e bacterial translocation, that is related to ME/CFS and ADS/IBS and that may drive systemic inflammatory processes.

AB  - Background Intestinal permeability has been studied in small groups of IBS patients with contrasting findings. Aims To assess intestinal permeability at different sites of the GI tract in different subtypes of well-characterised IBS patients and healthy controls (HC), and to assess potential confounding factors. Methods IBS patients and HC underwent a multi-sugar test to assess site-specific intestinal permeability. Sucrose excretion and lactulose/rhamnose ratio in 0-5 h urine indicated gastroduodenal and small intestinal permeability, respectively. Sucralose/erythritol ratio in 0-24 h and 5-24 h urine indicated whole gut and colonic permeability, respectively. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between IBS groups and intestinal permeability and to adjust for age, sex, BMI, anxiety or depression, smoking, alcohol intake and use of medication. Results Ninety-one IBS patients, i.e. 37% IBS-D, 23% IBS-C, 33% IBS-M and 7% IBS-U and 94 HC were enrolled. Urinary sucrose excretion was significantly increased in the total IBS group [μmol, median (Q1;Q3): 5.26 (1.82;11.03) vs. 2.44 (0.91;5.85), P < 0.05], as well as in IBS-C and IBS-D vs. HC. However, differences attenuated when adjusting for confounders. The lactulose/rhamnose ratio was increased in IBS-D vs. HC [0.023 (0.013;0.038) vs. 0.014 (0.008;0.025), P < 0.05], which remained significant after adjustment for confounders. No difference was found in 0-24 and 5-24 h sucralose/erythritol ratio between groups. Conclusions Small intestinal permeability is increased in patients with IBS-D compared to healthy controls, irrespective of confounding factors. Adjustment for confounders is necessary when studying intestinal permeability, especially in a heterogeneous disorder such as IBS. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Alcohol consumption is a potential trigger for flare in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare because of alcohol's pro-oxidant effects and its deleterious effects on gut barrier function. The association with alcohol consumption and IBD flare is unclear. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the pattern of alcohol consumption and its self-reported effect on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in patients with IBD. We recruited 129 consecutive patients: 52 patients with Crohn's disease, 38 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 39 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). All the participants completed a validated questionnaire on disease activity (the Crohn's disease activity index or ulcerative colitis clinical activity index, respectively) validated questionnaires to quantify alcohol consumption by National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism criteria, and two structured questionnaires we designed to access patients' perception of the effect of alcohol on their GI symptoms and on overall GI symptom severity. The pattern of current, light, moderate, and heavy alcohol consumption in inactive IBD was similar to the general U.S. population. Specifically, of the 90 inactive IBD patients, 56 (62%) were current drinkers, compared with 61% in the general U.S. population. Of current drinkers, 75% of IBD (N=42) and 43% of IBS (N=9) reported a worsening of GI symptoms with alcohol consumption (P=.01); however, overall GI symptom severity did not differ when compared with quantity of alcohol consumed. Patients with inactive IBD drink alcohol in quantities similar to the general population. Current drinkers with inactive IBD are more likely to report worsening of GI symptoms with alcohol than current drinkers with IBS. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Proteasome-mediated protein degradation may contribute to the regulation of intestinal inflammation. At the same time, low-grade inflammation and increased intestinal permeability seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thus, we aimed to evaluate proteasome composition and activities in colonic mucosa of IBS patients and its putative pathogenic role.METHODS: Proteasome activities and proteasome subunit expression were measured in colonic mucosa of IBS, Crohn's disease (CD), and control patients by fluorometric assays and western blot, respectively. Expression of inhibitor of kappa B factor (IBα) and occludin, a tight junction protein, was also evaluated in colonic biopsies. The degradation of recombinant occludin incubated with protein extracts from colonic mucosa was evaluated in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor, MG132.RESULTS: Proteasome trypsin-like activity was increased in IBS patients compared with CD and controls, whereas chymotrypsin-like activity was upregulated in CD patients only. Caspase-like activity was reduced both in IBS and CD patients. IBα expression was similar between IBS and controls. In contrast, occludin expression was lower in IBS than in controls, but occludin mRNA level was similar. Protein extracts from IBS patients but not from controls degraded recombinant occludin (20% over 160 min), which was blocked by MG132. Although mast cell number was increased in IBS patients, no correlation was found between this number and proteasome alterations.CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that proteasome alterations are present in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients and may contribute to the pathophysiology of IBS by increasing occludin degradation. © 2010 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Genome wide association studies and meta-analyses identified risk factors related to epithelial integrity of the intestinal barrier, innate immune responses and autophagy in inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) and celiac disease. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), coexists and shares common, although milder, features with IBD and celiac disease. Although our knowledge on genetic variability in IBS symptom generation is very limited, smaller scale studies attempt to provide insight in the mechanisms underlying IBS. Camilleri et al. identified associations for susceptibility loci in inflammatory and epithelial barrier genes with colonic transit in lower FGID. Their report is the first descriptive study to assess potential genetic factors involved in motor function. Further exploration of genetic variation in IBS will be crucial to unravel its' pathogenesis. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of probiotics in various areas of gastrointestinal (GI) health. Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that provide beneficial health effects on the host when administered in adequate amounts. Various probiotics have been shown to suppress bacterial growth, modulate the immune system and improve intestinal barrier function. However, despite several studies with promising results, most trials are small and many have substantial methodological limitations. However, with better targeting and appropriate randomised controlled trials, this area may soon yield important therapeutic strategies to optimise GI health. Here, we review the current knowledge of probiotics of relevance to luminal GI health. © 2012 The Authors; Internal Medicine Journal © 2012 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.

AB  - Background Intestinal epithelial dysfunction is a common pathophysiologic feature in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and might be the link to its clinical manifestations. We previously showed that chronic psychosocial stress induces jejunal epithelial barrier dysfunction; however, whether this epithelial response is gender-specific and might thus explain the enhanced female susceptibility to IBS remains unknown. Methods Intestinal responses to acute stress were compared in age-matched groups of healthy women and men (n=10 each) experiencing low background stress. A 20-cm jejunal segment, was perfused with an isosmotic solution, and intestinal effluents were collected under basal conditions, for 15min during cold pain stress and for a 45-min recovery period. Epithelial function (net water flux and albumin output), changes in stress hormones, and cardiovascular and psychologic responses to cold stress were measured. Key Results Heart rate and blood pressure significantly increased during cold pain stress with no differences between men and women. Adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels during cold pain stress were significantly higher in men. Basal net water flux and epithelial permeability were similar in men and women. Cold pain stress increased water flux in both groups (72±23 and 107±18μLmin-1cm-1, respectively; F(5, 90)=5.5; P=0.003 for Time) and, interestingly, this was associated with a marked increase of albumin permeability in women but not in men (0.8±0.2 vs.-0.7±0.2mg/15min; P<0.0001). Conclusions & Inferences Intestinal macromolecular permeability in response to acute experimental stress is increased in healthy women, a mechanism that may contribute to female oversusceptibility to IBS. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background Alterations in gastrointestinal (GI) permeability and immune measures are present in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but the relationship to symptoms is poorly defined. In adults with IBS, we compared permeability, unstimulated peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC) interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, IBS life interference, and GI and psychological distress symptoms. Methods In 88 women and 18 men with IBS, GI permeability was quantitated as percent recovery of urinary sucrose and the lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio. IL-10 was measured in supernatants from 72-h incubated, unstimulated PBMCs. Participants completed a 4-week daily diary recording IBS life interference on daily activities and work, IBS symptoms, and psychological distress symptoms. They also completed the Brief Symptom Inventory. Results The L/M ratio but not percent sucrose recovery was significantly correlated with IBS interference with activities and work and retrospectively measured anxiety and depression. Unstimulated PBMC production of IL-10 correlated significantly with IBS interference with daily work, IBS symptom score, and abdominal pain. We identified a subgroup of IBS subjects with higher IL-10 and/or higher L/M ratio who had substantially higher IBS interference and IBS symptom scores. Conclusions Our findings suggest a distinct subgroup of IBS patients with alterations in gut barrier function. This subgroup is characterized by increased GI permeability and/or increased PBMC production of IL-10. These physiologic alterations reflect more severe IBS as measured by interference of IBS with daily activities and daily IBS symptoms. © 2014 Springer Japan.

AB  - Introduction. Although combination therapy with herbal medicine and probiotics is gaining popularity for controlling diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS) symptoms, few studies have investigated its clinical effects. Materials and Methods. Fifty-three patients with D-IBS were randomly allocated into 1 of the following 4 groups: herbal medicine (Gwakhyangjeonggisan; GJS) plus probiotics (Duolac7S; DUO), GJS plus placebo DUO, placebo GJS plus DUO, and placebo GJS plus placebo DUO. The study period consisted of a 2-week run-in, 8 weeks of administration, and 2 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcomes were weekly adequate relief (AR) of overall IBS symptoms and the proportion of responders (PR) during the administration period. The secondary outcomes included individual IBS symptoms, stool assessment, and quality of life. Changes of intestinal microbiota and intestinal permeability were also analyzed. Results and Discussion. Weekly AR was not different among the 4 groups throughout the treatment period. However, the 3 treatment groups exhibited significant improvements in PR compared to the findings in the placebo group. In the intestinal microbiota assessment, herbal medicine and probiotics synergistically increased beneficial bacteria counts. Conclusion. Combination therapy with herbal medicine and probiotics appears to relieve overall IBS symptoms by synergistically increasing beneficial intestinal microbe counts. © 2013 Seok-Jae Ko et al.

AB  - Despite well-known intestinal epithelial barrier impairment and visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and IBS-like models, structural and physical changes in the mucus layer remain poorly understood. Using a water avoidance stress (WAS) model, we aimed at evaluating whether 1) WAS modified gut permeability, visceral sensitivity, mucin expression, biochemical structure of O-glycans, and related mucus physical properties, and 2) whether Lactobacillus farciminis treatment prevented these alterations. Wistar rats received orally L. farciminis or vehicle for 14 days; at day 10, they were submitted to either sham or 4-day WAS. Intestinal paracellular permeability and visceral sensitivity were measured in vivo. The number of goblet cells and Muc2 expression were evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Mucosal adhesion of L. farciminis was determined ex situ. The mucin O-glycosylation profile was obtained by mass spectrometry. Surface imaging of intestinal mucus was performed at nanoscale by atomic force microscopy. WAS induced gut hyperpermeability and visceral hypersensitivity but did not modify either the number of intestinal goblet cells or Muc2 expression. In contrast, O-glycosylation of mucins was strongly affected, with the appearance of elongated polylactosaminic chain containing O-glycan structures, associated with flattening and loss of the mucus layer cohesive properties. L. farciminis bound to intestinal Muc2 and prevented WAS-induced functional alterations and changes in mucin O-glycosylation and mucus physical properties. WAS-induced functional changes were associated with mucus alterations resulting from a shift in O-glycosylation rather than from changes in mucin expression. L. farciminis treatment prevented these alterations, conferring epithelial and mucus barrier strengthening. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Gut microbiota alterations are increasingly being recognized as an important factor in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The onset of IBS symptoms after a bout of gastroenteritis comprises one of the strongest indications for the importance of gut microbiota for IBS. Moreover, recent studies have identified several susceptibility genes for IBS involved in the innate immunity and recognition of bacteria but also maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier. During recent years, it has also been demonstrated that IBS patients, or subgroups thereof, may have an altered microbiota composition relative to healthy individuals, mainly based on the analysis of fecal microbiota. Moreover, a positive effect of treatment with non-absorbable antibiotics and probiotics in IBS provides further indirect support for the relevance of gut microbiota alterations in IBS. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background & aims: Increased intestinal permeability of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients has been recently associated with a decreased level of glutamine synthetase. Neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) is considered as an IBS-like model. The aim of our study was to investigate whether early nutritional intervention with glutamine may attenuate the deleterious impact of early life stress on gut barrier function in NMD. Methods: 124 rat pups were separated from their dam 3 h daily during postnatal days 2-14, or left undisturbed (NS). Separated rats received by gavage either with alanyl-glutamine (GLN), an isonitrogenous amino acid mix (AA, control) or an equal amount of drinking water (H2O). Production of cytokines was measured by multiplex, expression of COX-2, PPARγ, tight junction proteins and TLR4 by western blot. Intestinal permeability was studied by Lactulose/Mannitol test. Results: Treatment of pups with GLN or AA abolished the decrease in body weight observed in NMD. Treatment with GLN decreased in the colon (i) TLR4 expression at D20, (ii) IL-2 and -10 productions at D60 (iii) protein expression of occludin at D20 compared to AA. GLN also decreased colon expression of COX2 and PPARγ at D60 compared to NS. Colon production of IFNγ is significantly reduced by GLN compared to H2O. No significant change in intestinal permeability was observed. Conclusions: These results showed that an early nutritional intervention with alanyl-glutamine specifically abolished the up-regulation of TLR4 expression in NMD. Glutamine may be evaluated as a potential treatment for IBS patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

AB  - Few models currently exist to realistically simulate the complex human intestine's micro-environment, where a variety of interactions take place. Proper homeostasis directly depends on these interactions, as they shape an entire immunological response inducing tolerance against food antigens while at the same time mounting effective immune responses against pathogenic microbes accidentally ingested with food. Intestinal homeostasis is preserved also through various complex interactions between the microbiota (including food-associated beneficial bacterial strains) and the host, that regulate the attachment/degradation of mucus, the production of antimicrobial peptides by the epithelial barrier, and the education of epithelial cells' that controls the tolerogenic or immunogenic phenotype of unique, gut-resident lymphoid cells' populations. These interactions have been so far very difficult to reproduce with in vitro assays using either cultured cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, mouse models differ substantially in components of the intestinal mucosa (mucus layer organization, commensal bacteria community) with respect to the human gut. Thus, studies of a variety of treatments to be brought in the clinics for important stress-related or pathological conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer have been difficult to carry out. To address these issues, we developed a novel system that enables us to stimulate explants of human intestinal mucosa that retain their in situ conditioning by the host microbiota and immune response, in a polarized fashion. Polarized apical stimulation is of great importance for the outcome of the elicited immune response. It has been repeatedly shown that the same stimuli can produce completely different responses when they bypass the apical face of the intestinal epithelium, stimulating epithelial cells basolaterally or coming into direct contact with lamina propria components, switching the phenotype from tolerogenic to immunogenic and causing unnecessary and excessive inflammation in the area. We achieved polarized stimulation by gluing a cave cylinder which delimited the area of stimulation on the apical face of the mucosa as will be described in the protocol. We used this model to examine, among others, differential effects of three different Lactobacilli strains. We show that this model system is very powerful to assess the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics in healthy and disease conditions.

AB  - Objectives: Recent studies have suggested that an increased intestinal permeability is involved in the pathophysilogy of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the differential expression of tight junctions (TJs) proteins according to IBS subtypes and symptoms remained unknown. The objective of this study was to study zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, and claudin-1 in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS. Methods: Fifty IBS patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria and 31 controls were included. All types of IBS patients participated with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D, n=19), predominant constipation (IBS-C, n=14), constipation alternating with diarrhea (IBS-A, n=15), or unclassified (IBS-U, n=2). IBS symptom intensity was quantified on 10-cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). TJ proteins (claudin-1, ZO-1, occludin) were quantified by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot, while their localization was determined by immunofluorescence. Results: ZO-1 and occludin expression was lower in IBS patients compared with controls, whereas only a trend for a decrease of claudin-1 was observed. The mRNA levels remained unaffected. In the subgroup analyses, occludin and claudin-1 expression was decreased in IBS-D patients but not in IBS-C and IBS-A patients. The subcellular distribution of these three proteins was altered in IBS-C and IBS-D patients. Occludin (r=0.40, P<0.01) and claudin-1 (r=0.46, P<0.01) expression was correlated with the duration of symptoms. The expression of occludin was lower in patients with an abdominal pain intensity higher than 6 on the VAS (P<0.05). Conclusions: Occludin and claudin-1 appeared markedly affected in IBS-D patients. In addition, our results suggest that alteration of TJ proteins may be involved in the initiation of IBS and contribute to visceral hypersensitivity. © 2011 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

AB  - The intestinal epithelium plays an active immunologic role in preventing the uptake of foreign antigens. Additionally, the intestinal mucosa is an active site for immune suppression through the development of oral tolerance. Dysfunction of any aspect of the intestinal barrier, such as impairment of intestinal tight junctions, immunologic dysregulation or decreased oral tolerance will lead to overstimulation of the immune system upon exposure to foreign antigens and subsequent unregulated chronic intestinal inflammation. This persistent inflammatory activity may potentially predispose the patient to the development of intestinal autoimmune disease. An active immune response possibly directed against intestinal flora has been postulated to be the underlying etiology for inflammatory bowel disease. Failure of oral tolerance is thought predispose a patient to celiac disease and possibly eosinophilic esophagitis. Additionally, an active immunologic response to absorbed antigen may be the underlying etiology for the development of autoimmune liver disease © 2014 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) relieves symptoms in children with recurrent abdominal pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 141 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional pain were enrolled in 9 primary care sites and a referral center. Children entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and received LGG or placebo for 8 weeks and entered follow-up for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was overall pain at the end of the intervention period. At entry and at the end of the trial, children underwent a double-sugar intestinal permeability test. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, LGG, but not placebo, caused a significant reduction of both frequency (P < .01) and severity (P < .01) of abdominal pain. These differences still were significant at the end of follow-up (P < .02 and P < .001, respectively). At week 12, treatment success was achieved in 48 children in the LGG group compared with 37 children in the placebo group (P < .03); this difference still was present at the end of follow-up (P < .03). At entry, 59% of the children had abnormal results from the intestinal permeability test; LGG, but not placebo, determined a significant decrease in the number of patients with abnormal results from the intestinal permeability testing (P < .03). These effects mainly were in children with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: LGG significantly reduces the frequency and severity of abdominal pain in children with IBS; this effect is sustained and may be secondary to improvement of the gut barrier.

AB  - Background and Aims: Research has increasingly suggested that gut flora plays an important role in the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). Studies of the curative effect of probiotics for IBS have usually been positive but not always. However, the differences of treatment effects and mechanisms among probiotic stains, or mixture of them, are not clear. In this study, we compared the effects of different probiotics (Befidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus or mixture of the three) on intestinal sensation, barrier function and intestinal immunity in PI-IBS mouse model. Methods: PI-IBS model was induced by Trichinella spiralis infection in mice. Different probiotics were administered to mice after 8 weeks infection. Visceral sensitivity was measured by scores of abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and the threshold intensity of colorectal distention. Colonic smooth muscle contractile response was assessed by contraction of the longitudinal muscle strips. Plasma diamine oxidase (DAO) and d-lactate were determined by an enzymatic spectrophotometry. Expression of tight junction proteins and cytokines in ileum were measured by Western blotting. Results: Compared to control mice, PI-IBS mice treated either alone with Befidobacterium or Lactobacillus (but not Streptococcus), or the mixture of the three exhibited not only decreased AWR score and contractile response, but also reduced plasma DAO and D-lactate. These probiotic treatments also suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and IL-17 and promoted the expression of major tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin. The mixture of the three probiotic strains performed better than the individual in up-regulating these tight junction proteins and suppressing IL-17 expression. Conclusions: Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, but not Streptococcus, alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and recovered intestinal barrier function as well as inflammation in PI-IBS mouse model, which correlated with an increase of major tight junction proteins. In addition, Mixture of three species was indicated to be superior to a single one. © 2014 Wang et al.

AB  - Background Alterations in serotonergic (5-HT) metabolism and/or intestinal integrity have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Aims To assess the effects of the precursor of 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on mucosal 5-HT availability and intestinal integrity, and to assess potential differences between healthy controls and IBS patients. Methods Fifteen IBS patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study. Intestinal integrity was assessed by dual-sugar test and by determining the mucosal expression of tight junction proteins after ingestion of an oral bolus of 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo. Mucosal serotonergic metabolism was assessed in duodenal biopsy samples. Results 5-HTP administration significantly increased mucosal levels of 5-HIAA, the main metabolite of 5-HT, in both healthy controls (7.1 ± 1.7 vs. 2.5 ± 0.7 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P = 0.02) and IBS patients (20.0 ± 4.8 vs. 8.1 ± 1.3 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P = 0.02), with the latter group showing a significantly larger increase. Lactulose/L-rhamnose ratios were significantly lower after administration of 5-HTP (P < 0.05) in healthy controls and were accompanied by redistribution of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), pointing to reinforcement of the barrier. In IBS, expression of the tight junction proteins was significantly lower compared to healthy controls, and 5-HTP resulted in a further decrease in occludin expression. Conclusions Oral 5-HTP induced alterations in mucosal 5-HT metabolism. In healthy controls, a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier was seen whereas such reaction was absent in IBS patients. This could indicate the presence of a serotonin-mediated mechanism aimed to reinforce intestinal barrier function, which seems to dysfunction in IBS patients. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a proinflammatory lipid mediator produced in excess in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PGE2 couples to and signals via four different E-prostanoid (EP) receptors, namely EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. In this study, we determined a role for PGE2 and EP4 receptors in altering colonic epithelial barrier integrity. In healthy colonic mucosa, EP4 receptors were localized on apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells at the tip of mucosal folds, whereas, in patients with IBD and in rats with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, they were diffusely overexpressed throughout the mucosa. Similarly, expression of EP4 receptor was polarized in T84 colonic epithelial monolayer and mimics the normal epithelium. Apical exposure of T84 monolayer with high levels of PGE2 decreased barrier integrity, which was abrogated by an EP4 receptor antagonist. To reveal the mechanism of vectorial transport of basally produced PGE2 toward apical EP4 receptors, we identified prostaglandin transporters (PGT) in human colonic epithelia. PGT were least expressed on epithelial cells at the colonic mucosal folds of control subjects but overexpressed in epithelial cells of patients with IBD or animals with DSS-induced colitis. T84 monolayer also expressed PGT, which increased twofold following stimulation with TNF-α. Importantly, in T84 monolayer stimulated with TNF-α, there was a corresponding increase in the uptake and vectorial transport of 3H-PGE2 to the apical surface. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of PGT significantly decreased vectorial transport of 3H-PGE2. These studies unravel a mechanism whereby EP4 receptor and PGT play a role in PGE2-induced alteration of epithelial barrier integrity in colitis. Copyright © 2010 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is a common disorder wherein symptoms of IBS begin after an episode of acute gastroenteritis. Published studies have reported incidence of PI-IBS to range between 5% and 32%. The mechanisms underlying the development of PI-IBS are not fully understood, but are believed to include persistent sub-clinical inflammation, changes in intestinal permeability and alteration of gut flora. Individual studies have suggested that risk factors for PI-IBS include patients' demographics, psychological disorders and the severity of enteric illness. However, PI-IBS remains a diagnosis of exclusion with no specific disease markers and, to date, no definitive therapy exists. The prognosis of PI-IBS appears favorable with spontaneous and gradual resolution of symptoms in most patients. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mammalian GI tract contains a large and diverse ecosystem of microorganisms that play a profound role in our development and physiology. Interestingly, the microbial make-up within the intestine has been found to be altered in many clinically important diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Types 1 and 2 diabetes, and obesity. Barman et al. used a Salmonella-induced murine model of gastroenteritis to show that the intestinal microbiota are transiently altered during the host inflammatory response to infection. These findings are of interest as understanding how the microbiota are altered during disease states may offer insight into which microbial populations are important in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Recently, probiotics have been shown to modulate the mucosal immune system and improve intestinal barrier function, validating their potential as therapeutics for gastrointestinal-associated diseases. As we begin to understand the benefits conferred to the intestine by microbiota, the use of probiotics to modify its composition is an attractive option to improve human health. © 2008 Expert Reviews Ltd.

AB  - Background and Aims: Psychological stress is a predisposing factor in the onset and exacerbation of important gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The pathophysiology of stress-induced intestinal disturbances is known to be mediated by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) but the precise signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Utilizing a porcine ex vivo intestinal model, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which CRF mediates intestinal epithelial barrier disturbances. Methodology: Ileum was harvested from 6-8 week-old pigs, mounted on Ussing Chambers, and exposed to CRF in the presence or absence of various pharmacologic inhibitors of CRF-mediated signaling pathways. Mucosal-to-serosal flux of 4 kDa-FITC dextran (FD4) and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) were recorded as indices of intestinal epithelial barrier function. Results: Exposure of porcine ileum to 0.05-0.5 μM CRF increased (p<0.05) paracellular flux compared with vehicle controls. CRF treatment had no deleterious effects on ileal TER. The effects of CRF on FD4 flux were inhibited with pre-treatment of tissue with the non-selective CRF1/2 receptor antagonist Astressin B and the mast cell stabilizer sodium cromolyn (10-4M). Furthermore, anti-TNF-α neutralizing antibody (p<0.01), protease inhibitors (p<0.01) and the neural blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) inhibited CRF-mediated intestinal barrier dysfunction. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that CRF triggers increases in intestinal paracellular permeability via mast cell dependent release of TNF-α and proteases. Furthermore, CRF-mast cell signaling pathways and increases in intestinal permeability require critical input from the enteric nervous system. Therefore, blocking the deleterious effects of CRF may address the enteric signaling of mast cell degranulation, TNFα release, and protease secretion, hallmarks of IBS and IBD. © 2012 Overman et al.

AB  - Objectives: Diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is characterised by elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the origin of this elevated serine protease activity, (2) to evaluate if it may be sufficient to trigger alterations in colonic paracellular permeability (CPP) and sensitivity, and (3) to examine the role of the proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) activation and signalling cascade in this process. Patients and methods: Faecal enzymatic activities were assayed in healthy subjects and patients with IBS, ulcerative colitis and acute infectious diarrhoea. Following mucosal exposure to supernatants from control subjects and IBS-D patients, electromyographic response to colorectal balloon distension was recorded in wild-type and PAR-2-/- mice, and CPP was evaluated on colonic strips in Ussing chambers. Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and phosphorylated myosin light chain were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: The threefold increase in faecal serine protease activity seen in IBS-D patients compared with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) or infectious diarrhoea is of neither epithelial nor inflammatory cell origin, nor is it coupled with antiprotease activity of endogenous origin. Mucosal application of faecal supernatants from IBS-D patients in mice evoked allodynia and increased CPP by 92%, both of which effects were prevented by serine protease inhibitors and dependent on PAR-2 expression. In mice, colonic exposure to supernatants from IBS-D patients resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and delayed redistribution of ZO-1 in colonocytes. Conclusions: Elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity of IBS-D patients evokes a PAR-2-mediated colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction and subsequent allodynia in mice, suggesting a novel organic background in the pathogenesis of IBS.

AB  - Background: Linaclotide has been proposed as a treatment for the same gastrointestinal indications for which lubiprostone has been approved, chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Stressors damage the epithelial cell barrier and cellular homeostasis leading to loss of these functions. Effects of active linaclotide on repair of barrier and cell function in pig jejunum after ischemia and in T84 cells after treatment with proinflammatory cytokines, interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α were examined. Comparison with effects of lubiprostone, known to promote repair of barrier function was carried out.Results: In ischemia-damaged pig jejunum, using measurements of transepithelial resistance, 3H-mannitol fluxes, short-circuit current (Cl- secretion) and occludin localization, active linaclotide failed to effectively promote repair of the epithelial barrier or recovery of short-circuit current, whereas lubiprostone promoted barrier repair and increased short-circuit current. In control pig jejunum, 1 μM linaclotide and 1 μM lubiprostone both caused similar increases in short-circuit current (Cl- secretion). In T84 cells, using measurements of transepithelial resistance, fluxes of fluorescent macromolecules, occludin and mitochondrial membrane potential, active linaclotide was virtually ineffective against damage caused by interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α, while lubiprostone protected or promoted repair of epithelial barrier and cell function. Barrier protection/repair by lubiprostone was inhibited by methadone, a ClC-2 inhibitor. Linaclotide, but not lubiprostone increased [cGMP]i as expected and [Ca2+]i and linaclotide depolarized while lubiprostone hyperpolarized the T84 plasma membrane potential suggesting that lubiprostone may lead to greater cellular stability compared to linaclotide. In T84 cells, as found with linaclotide but not with lubiprostone, transepithelial resistance was slightly but significantly decreased by guanylin, STa and 8-bromo cGMP and fluorescent dextran fluxes were increased by guanylin. However the physiological implications of these small but statistically significant changes remain unclear.Conclusions: Considering the physiological importance of epithelial barrier function and cell integrity and the known impact of stressors, the finding that lubiprostone, but not active linaclotide, exhibits the additional distinct property of effective protection or repair of the epithelial barrier and cell function after stress suggests potential clinical importance for patients with impaired or compromised barrier function such as might occur in IBS. © 2012 Cuppoletti et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by visceral hypersensitivity and altered bowel function. There are increasing evidences suggested that VSL#3 probiotics therapy has been recognized as an effective method to relieve IBS-induced symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of VSL#3 probiotics on visceral hypersensitivity (VH), nitric oxide (NO), fecal character, colonic epithelium permeability, and tight junction protein expression. IBS model was induced by intracolonic instillation of 4% acetic acid and restraint stress in rats. After subsidence of inflammation on the seventh experimental day, the rats were subjected to rectal distension, and then the abdominal withdrawal reflex and the number of fecal output were measured, respectively. Also, colonic permeability to Evans blue was measured in vivo, and tight junction protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting method. Rats had been pretreated with VSL#3 or aminoguanidine (NOS inhibitor) or VSL#3? aminoguanidine before measurements. The rats at placebo group showed hypersensitive response to rectal distension (P<0.05) and defecated more stools than control rats (P<0.05), whereas VSL#3 treatment significantly attenuated VH and effectively reduced defecation. Aminoguanidine reduced the protective effects of VSL#3 on VH. A pronounced increase in epithelial permeability and decreased expression of tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1) in placebo group were prevented by VSL#3, but not aminoguanidine. VSL#3 treatment reduce the hypersensitivity, defecation, colonic permeability and increase the expression of tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1). As the part of this effect was lowered by NOS inhibitor, NO might play a role in the protective effect of VSL#3 to some extent. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Acute bacterial gastroenteritis is the strongest risk factor identified to date for the subsequent development of postinfective irritable bowel syndrome. Clinical risk factors include prolonged acute illness and the absence of vomiting. A genetically determined susceptibility to inflammatory stimuli may also be a risk factor for irritable bowel syndrome. The underlying pathophysiology indicates increased intestinal permeability and low-grade inflammation, as well as altered motility and visceral sensitivity. The prognosis is similar to that of other forms of irritable bowel syndrome with over 50% of patients but the long-term complications are poorly understood. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Background: The intestinal permeability is increased in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). Aim: To determine the possible efficacy of lactic acid bacteria on the increased intestinal permeability in D-IBS. Methods: Treatment was employed for 4 weeks in a randomized single blind placebo controlled study with 30 D-IBS patients. Patients were given either probiotic fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Longum) or milk beverage containing no bacteria. The clinical symptoms were scored and intestinal permeability was measured by a triple sugar test before and after treatment. Results: Small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of lactulose and mannitol recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). After probiotics treatment, small bowel permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 (0.024) at baseline to 0.023 (0.020) (P = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel permeability was lower than baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.023). However, colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo group at week 4. Treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean global IBS scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 ± 1.05 vs. 7.64 ± 1.24, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Short-term active lactic acid bacteria treatment for D-IBS improved mucosal barrier function. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Studies of metagenomics and the human microbiome will tremendously expand our knowledge of the composition of microbial communities in the human body. As our understanding of microbial variation and corresponding genetic parameters is refined, this information can be applied to rational remodeling or "tailoring" of human-associated microbial communities and their associated functions. Physiologic features such as the development of innate and adaptive immunity, relative susceptibilities to infections, immune tolerance, bioavailability of nutrients, and intestinal barrier function may be modified by changing the composition and functions of the microbial communities. The specialty of gastroenterology will be affected profoundly by the ability to modify the gastrointestinal microbiota through the rational deployment of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics. Antibiotics might be used to remove or suppress undesirable components of the human microbiome. Probiotics can introduce missing microbial components with known beneficial functions for the human host. Prebiotics can enhance the proliferation of beneficial microbes or probiotics, to maximize sustainable changes in the human microbiome. Combinations of these approaches might provide synergistic and effective therapies for specific disorders. The human microbiome could be manipulated by such "smart" strategies to prevent and treat acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and a variety of other disorders. © 2009 AGA Institute.

AB  - Objective: To determine the role of colonic barrier defects and low-grade inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Design: Caecal biopsies were collected from 51 IBS, 49 quiescent IBD (31 Crohn's disease (CD) and 18 ulcerative colitis (UC)) patients and 27 controls. IBS was assessed using the Rome III criteria and the IBS severity score. Epithelial barrier integrity was evaluated by determining the paracellular permeability of biopsies mounted in Ussing chambers and the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, α-catenin and occludin). Low-grade inflammation was evaluated by counting cells, including intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), eosinophils and mast cells, and by determining the mRNA and protein expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in biopsies and culture supernatants. Results: IBS-like symptoms were present in 35.4 and 38% of CD and UC patients, respectively. Paracellular permeability was significantly increased in both quiescent IBD with IBS-like symptoms and IBS compared with quiescent IBD without IBS-like symptoms (p<0.01, respectively) or controls (p<0.01, respectively). Significantly lower expression of ZO-1 and α-catenin was detected in IBS and quiescent IBD with IBS-like symptoms. IELs and TNF-α were significantly increased in quiescent IBD with IBS-like symptoms, but not in IBS. Conclusions: In quiescent IBD, IBS-like symptoms related to persistent subclinical inflammation associated with increased colonic paracellular permeability. A persistent increase in TNF-α in colonic mucosa may contribute to the epithelial barrier defects associated with abdominal pain in quiescent IBD, but not in IBS. Optimisation of anti-inflammatory therapy may be considered in quiescent IBD with IBS-like symptoms.

AB  - Intestinal permeability and the effect of NSAIDs on permeability were investigated in 14 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and 15 healthy subjects. In the study, 24-h urinary recoveries of orally administered polyethylene glycols (PEGs 400, 1500, and 4000) were not significantly different in healthy subjects and IBS patients before or after NSAID ingestion. Lactulose mannitol ratios in healthy subjects and IBS patients were not significantly different. Only time-dependent monitoring of PEG excretion showed that NSAIDs enhanced intestinal permeability for PEG 4000 in healthy subjects (P = 0.050) and for PEGs 400, 1500, and 4000 in IBS patients (P = 0.012, P = 0.041, and P = 0.012, respectively). These results show that intestinal permeability in IBS patients is not different from that in healthy subjects; NSAIDs compromise intestinal permeability in IBS patients to a greater extent than in healthy subjects, which suggests that IBS is associated with an altered response of the intestinal barrier to noxious agents. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Approximately 25% of patients with irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea (IBS-D) have increased total fecal bile acids (BA) and serum C4 (surrogate for BA synthesis). BA synthesis-related genes (KLB and FGFR4) are associated with colonic transit (CT) in IBS-D. Our aims were: (i) to compare phenotype and pathophysiology in IBS-D patients with increased or normal fecal excretion or synthesis of BA; and (ii) to explore association of variations in two candidate bile-acid synthesis genes (KLB and FGFR4) in these two subgroups of IBS-D.; METHODS: A total of 64 IBS-D patients underwent on one occasion: fasting serum C4 and FGF19, total fecal fat and BA excretion, CT, intestinal and colonic permeability, and candidate genotyping (rs17618244 (KLB), rs351855 (FGFR4)). Colonic sensation and tone were measured in 47 of the IBS-D patients. IBS-D subgroups were identified by fecal BA >2,337 mM per 48 h or by serum C4 >47.1 ng/ml.; RESULTS: IBS-D patients with fecal BA >2,337 mM per 48 h (19/54) had significantly greater body mass index, fecal fat, percent chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in feces, and intestinal permeability, and borderline increased CT (P=0.13). Those IBS-D patients with serum C4 >47.1 ng/ml (13/54) had increased total fecal BA excretion and borderline increased colonic permeability. Variants in genes involved in feedback regulation of BA synthesis (KLB, P=0.06 and FGFR4, P=0.09) were potentially associated with the subgroup with elevated serum C4.; CONCLUSIONS: IBS-D with increased BA excretion or synthesis is associated with significant pathophysiological changes relative to patients with normal BA profile. BA diarrhea is identified more effectively with total fecal BA than with serum C4.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between platelet (PLT) serotonin (5-HT) and intestinal permeability in children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Differential sugar absorption and PLT 5-HT were determined in 23 children with PDD. PLT 5-HT (2.0-7.1 nmol/109 PLT) was elevated in 4/23 patients. None exhibited elevated intestinal permeability (lactulose/mannitol ratio: 0.008-0.035 mol/mol). PLT 5-HT did not correlate with intestinal permeability or GI tract complaints. PLT 5-HT correlated with 24 h urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA; p = .034). Also urinary 5-HIAA and urinary 5-HT were interrelated (p = .005). A link between hyperserotonemia and increased intestinal permeability remained unsupported. Increased PLT 5-HT in PDD is likely to derive from increased PLT exposure to 5-HT. Longitudinal studies, showing the (in)consistency of abnormal intestinal permeability and PLT 5-HT, may resolve present discrepancies in the literature. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Background: The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are poorly understood. One mechanism may involve increased intestinal permeability that is reversed with glutamine supplementation. Our goal was to evaluate the expression of glutamine synthetase and its complementary miRNA in blood microvesicles and gut tissues of IBS patients with increased intestinal membrane permeability. Methods: We evaluated 19 diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients and 10 controls for intestinal membrane permeability using the lactulose/mannitol method. miRNA expression was evaluated in blood microvesicles and gut tissue. To further confirm the relationship between miRNA and glutamine synthetase expression, cell culture experiments were conducted. Glutamine synthetase was also evaluated in the gut tissues of patients. Results: A subset of patients with IBS (8/19, 42%) had increased intestinal membrane permeability and decreased glutamine synthetase expression compared to patients with IBS normal membrane permeability, and to controls. Expression of miR-29a was increased in blood microvesicles, small bowel and colon tissues of IBS patients with increased intestinal membrane permeability. Increased intestinal permeability was modulated by miR-29a which has a complementary site in the 3′-UTR of the GLUL gene. Conclusions: The results support the conclusion that GLUL regulates intestinal membrane permeability and miR-29a regulates both GLUL and intestinal membrane permeability. The data suggests that miR-29a effects on intestinal membrane permeability may be due to its regulation of GLUL. Targeting this signalling pathway could lead to a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients with IBS, especially because small molecules that mimic or inhibit miRNA-based mechanisms are readily available.

AB  - Objective Intestinal permeability and psychological stress have been implicated in the pathophysiology of IBD and IBS. Studies in animals suggest that stress increases permeability via corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-mediated mast cell activation. Our aim was to investigate the effect of stress on intestinal permeability in humans and its underlying mechanisms. Design Small intestinal permeability was quantified by a 2 h lactulose-mannitol urinary excretion test. In a first study, 23 healthy volunteers were subjected to four different conditions: control; indomethacin; public speech and anticipation of electroshocks. In a second study, five test conditions were investigated in 13 volunteers: control; after pretreatment with disodium cromoglycate (DSCG); administration of CRH; DSCG+CRH and DSCG +public speech. Results Indomethacin, as a positive comparator (0.071 ±0.040 vs 0.030±0.022; p<0.0001), and public speech (0.059±0.040; p<0.01), but not the shock protocol increased intestinal permeability. Similarly, salivary cortisol was only increased after public speech. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the effect of public speech on permeability was only present in subjects with a significant elevation of cortisol. CRH increased the lactulose-mannitol ratio (0.042±0.021 vs 0.028±0.009; p=0.02), which was inhibited by the mast cell stabiliser DSCG. Finally, intestinal permeability was unaltered by public speech with DSCG pretreatment. Conclusions Acute psychological stress increases small intestinal permeability in humans. Peripheral CRH reproduces the effect of stress and DSCG blocks the effect of both stress and CRH, suggesting the involvement of mast cells. These findings provide new insight into the complex interplay between the central nervous system and GI function in man.

AB  - Background Fermented milk (FM) containing Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM I-2494 and yogurt strains improves irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in constipated IBS patients. In rats, stressful events exacerbate IBS symptoms and result in the alteration of gut sensitivity and permeability via epithelial cell cytoskeleton contraction. In a stress model, we aimed at evaluating the effect of B. lactis CNCM I-2494 as a pure strain or contained in an FM product on visceral sensitivity and the impact of this FM on intestinal barrier integrity. Methods Visceral sensitivity was analyzed in rats subjected to partial restraint stress (PRS). Rats received during 15days the B. lactis as a pure strain (10 6 to 10 10CFUmL -1), B. lactis in an FM product (10 8CFUg -1, diluted or not), or a control product. Gut paracellular permeability, colonic occluding and Jam-A proteins, and blood endotoxin levels were determined in rats receiving B. lactis in an FM product submitted or not to a PRS. Key Results The FM product showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity. A similar antihyperalgesic effect was observed at 10 10CFUmL -1 of pure B. lactis administration. The FM product prevented the increase in intestinal permeability induced by PRS and restored occludin and JAM-A expressions to control levels. The FM product abolished the increase concentration of blood endotoxin induced by PRS.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common gastrointestinal disorder, affecting more than 10% of the general population worldwide. Although a genetic component is suspected, unambiguous susceptibility genes have so far not been identified. This study tested the hypothesis that genes contributing to epithelial barrier integrity, control of mucosal immune responses and interactions with bacteria in the gut are associated with IBS. Methods: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) corresponding to top signals of association with Crohn's disease at 30 known susceptibility loci were tested for their effect on IBS risk in 1992 individuals from two independent case-control cohorts from Sweden and the USA. Association tests included a conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, and were also performed on specific subgroups of patients characterised by constipation (IBS-C), diarrhoea (IBS-D) or alternating constipation and diarrhoea (IBS-A). Results: The Crohn's disease risk allele rs4263839 G in the TNFSF15 gene was significantly associated with an increased risk of both IBS (p=2.2×10 -5; OR 1.37) and more pronouncedly, IBS-C (p=8.7×10 -7; OR 1.79) in the entire sample. Similar associations and risk effects of the same magnitude were observed in the two cohorts analysed separately. A correlation between rs4263839 genotype and TNFSF15 mRNA expression was detected both in peripheral blood and in rectal mucosal biopsies from healthy individuals (combined p=0.0033). Conclusions: TNFSF15 is a susceptibility gene for IBS and IBS constipation. As TL1A, the protein encoded by TNFSF15, contributes to the modulation of inflammatory responses, the results support a role of immune activation in IBS.

AB  - Background: Altered intestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation have been reported in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Increased cell extrusion in the epithelium as measured by epithelial gaps may be associated with barrier dysfunction and may lead to mucosal inflammation. Confocal laser endomicroscopy can be used to identify and quantitate epithelial gaps in the small intestine. Objective: To determine the epithelial gap density in IBS and healthy control patients. Design: Prospective, controlled cohort study. Setting: A tertiary referral center. Patients: In IBS and control patients undergoing routine colonoscopy, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy was used to image the terminal ileum. Main Outcome Measurements: The primary outcome was the density of epithelial gaps (gaps/cells counted) in adequately imaged villi using pCLE. Images were reviewed by 2 blinded reviewers. Results: We recruited 18 healthy controls and 16 IBS patients. The median epithelial gap densities for control and IBS patients were 6 and 32 gaps per 1000 cells, respectively (P <.001). There was a trend toward higher gap density in female (P =.07) and younger (ρ = -0.43, P =.07) patients. Using 3% (90% of the control population) as the cutoff for abnormal gap density, we found the diagnostic accuracy for IBS to be as follows: 62% sensitivity, 89% specificity, 83% positive predictive value, and 73% negative predictive value. Limitations: A single-center study, small number of patients. Conclusions: IBS patients have significantly more epithelial gaps in their small intestine compared with healthy controls, which suggests that increased epithelial cell extrusion may be a cause of altered intestinal permeability observed in IBS. © 2013 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

AB  - The relationship between the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and food intolerance is not clear. We studied the cutaneous response to food antigens in 43 volunteers who were students and employees of the Faculty of Medicine of Universidade Federal Fluminense. Subjects were divided into 3 groups after evaluation for Roma II criteria for functional disease of the gastrointestinal tract: group I, 14 volunteers with IBS; group II, 15 volunteers with functional dyspepsia; group III, 14 volunteers without habitual gastrointestinal symptoms. The subjects were submitted to the skin prick test with 9 food antigen extracts, for a total of 387 skin tests (9 per volunteer). Of the 126 tests applied to group I, 24 (19.4%) were positive (a 3-mm wider papule than the negative control) and of the 135 tests applied to group II, 3 (2.3%) were positive. Of the 126 tests applied to group III, 6 (4%) were positive. The number of positive responses obtained in group I (IBS) differed significantly from the other 2 groups (P < 0.01). None of the volunteers with IBS reported intolerance to any isolated food. The higher reactivity to food antigens in group I compared to groups II and III suggests that intestinal permeability may be increased in patients with IBS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with clinical signs typical of 'intestinal' food allergies or intolerance. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical features of IBS patients suspected of suffering from adverse reactions to food. METHODS: The study involved 128 consecutive IBS patients divided into four groups according to their main symptom on presentation at our outpatient clinic. A detailed medical history was recorded, paying particular attention to any allergies and reported intolerance to food. Each patient was screened for allergies; intestinal permeability tests was performed in randomly selected patients from different groups. Findings were analyzed using the X2 test. RESULTS: Adverse reactions to one or more foods were reported by 80 patients (62.5%); skin prick tests (SPT) were positive in 67 patients (52.3%) with no significant differences between patients complaining of different symptoms. Patients who reported a food intolerance had more positive SPTs than those who did not (47 of 80 [58.7%] vs 20 of 48 [41.7%]); this difference was not statistically significant, although it suggests a trend (p < 0.0610). There was little consistency between the specific foods reported to cause intolerance and those resulting from the tests (11 of 80 patients, 13.7%). The intestinal permeability test was normal in 29 of 33 patients (87.9%). CONCLUSIONS: More than 50% of IBS patients were found sensitized to some food or inhalant without any typical clinical signs. Patients were unable to identify potentially offending foods. The lack of a correlation between SPT results and reported food allergies needs further investigation to clarify the pathophysiology and improve the diagnosis of intestinal food allergies.

AB  - We studied 14 patients with irritable bowel syndrome for the presence of increased intestinal permeability to food antigens and their responses to diet with and without disodium cromoglycate. After a standardized oral challenge with cow milk, serum β-lactoglobulin was increased above control values in three patients. This finding did not correlate with response to hypoallergenic diet or treatment with disodium cromoglycate for 3 weeks. However over 50% of patients improved after diet with and without DSCG (2/5 on diet only and 5/7 with disodium cromoglycate of 12 evaluable cases). Since only two patients had elevated serum IgE levels, our results suggest that intolerance rather than hypersensitivity to foods may play a role in this disease. The tests we used to identify immmunologic mechanisms could not predict which patients would do better on the diet and/or the drug.

AB  - Background & Aims: Stressful life events are supposed to be involved in various diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome. Impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier function is a suspected consequence of stress, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the mechanisms through which stress modulates the colonic epithelial barrier. Methods: Cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was evaluated in murine colon, liver, and spleen by competitive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction after 1-4 days of daily 2-hour stress sessions. Colonic paracellular permeability was measured as the in vivo lumen-to-blood ratio of 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The effect of a myosin light chain (MLC) kinase inhibitor (ML-7) was assessed on stress-induced interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA expression and colonic epithelial barrier impairment, and MLC phosphorylation was determined by immunoblot. Finally, the incidence of repeated stress sessions on bacterial translocation was determined. Results: Repeated stress induced an overexpression of colonic IFN-γ. In the liver, higher levels of IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10 mRNAs were detected and were associated with bacterial translocation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Stress increased colonic permeability of control mice, but not of SCID and IFN-γ-deficient mice. ML-7 inhibited the stress-induced increased permeability, bacterial translocation, and cytokine overexpression in the liver and restored a normal histology. Larger amounts of phosphorylated MLC were detected in stressed animals. Conclusions: Repeated stress sessions drive organ-specific cytokine expression patterns and alter colonic mucosal barrier functions associated with bacterial translocation. This effect depends on the presence of CD4+ T cells and requires IFN-γ production and MLC phosphorylation.

AB  - Background and Aims: Differentiating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) from those of organic intestinal disease is a familiar problem for physicians. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios (ORs) of fecal calprotectin, small intestinal permeability, Rome I criteria, and laboratory markers of inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], blood count) in distinguishing organic from nonorganic intestinal disease. Methods: A total of 602 new referrals to a gastroenterology clinic who had symptoms suggestive of IBS or organic intestinal disease were studied for these parameters. All patients underwent invasive imaging (barium/endoscopic examination) and other investigations as appropriate, with physicians blinded to the results of fecal calprotectin and intestinal permeability. Results: A total of 263 patients were diagnosed with organic disease and 339 with IBS. At 10 mg/L, the sensitivity and specificity of calprotectin for organic disease were 89% and 79%, respectively, and that of intestinal permeability for small intestinal disease were 63% and 87%, respectively. Sensitivity of positive Rome criteria for IBS was 85% with a specificity of 71%. An abnormal calprotectin test had an OR for disease of 27.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.6-43.7; P < 0.0001) compared with ORs of 4.2 (95% Cl, 2.9-6.1; P < 0.0001) and 3.2 (95% CI, 2.2-4.6; P < 0.0001) for elevated CRP and ESR values. An abnormal permeability test gave an OR of 8.9 (95% CI, 5.8-14.0; P < 0.0001) for small intestinal disease. The OR for IBS with positive Rome criteria was 13.3 (95% CI, 8.9-20.0). Conclusions: Fecal calprotectin, intestinal permeability, and positive Rome I criteria provide a safe and noninvasive means of helping differentiate between patients with organic and nonorganic intestinal disease. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - 1. In order to develop an improved differential sugar absorption test for simultaneously assessing intestinal permeability and lactose intolerance, methods were established for determining raffinose, lactose and L-arabinose in human urine. Using NAD(P)H-coupled enzymatic assays and fluorimetry, each sugar was measurable over a concentration range of approximately 3-300 μmol/l in diluted urine specimens. 2. After an overnight fast, 40 normal volunteers drank an iso-osmotic solution containing raffinose, lactose and L-arabinose. The median 5 h urinary sugar excretion was 0.26% of the ingested raffinose, 0.05% of lactose and 17.5% of L-arabinose. 3. In 143 patients with gastrointestinal disease, excretion of both ingested raffinose and lactose was significantly increased in coeliac disease in relapse or in partial remission and in Crohn's disease, but not in the irritable bowel syndrome, coeliac disease in remission or ulcerative colitis. Excretion of lactose, but not raffinose, was increased in patients with mucosal lactase deficiency, whereas excretion of L-arabinose was reduced in all disease groups except ulcerative colitis. 4. Discrimination between diseases was poor when based on individual sugar recoveries, but improved dramatically when excretion was expressed relative to that of L-arabinose. The raffinose/L-arabinose excretion ratio, an index of intestinal permeability, was > 0.08 in 15/15 untreated coeliac patients but < 0.06 in all normal subjects and in 9/9 lactase-deficient patients, 15/16 recovered coeliac patients, 5/6 patients with ulcerative colitis, 13/16 patients with Crohn's disease and 61/62 patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - Morphological and functional changes were examined in the upper jejunum and terminal ileum of 18 patients suffering from Crohn's disease. Intestinal permeability, biochemical determination of enzymatic activities, and morphologic evaluation of the severity of the lesions were evaluated. Ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome patients served as controls. We found abnormal lactulose-mannitol tests in all patients with active Crohn's disease. Permeability changes correlated with increased crypt cell proliferation, as indicated by thymidine kinase activity. A significant reduction in brush border enzyme activities was seen in the terminal ileum, but no significant change was observed in the unaffected upper jejunum. The number of mast cells was increased in the diseased ileum. We conclude that the site of inflammation and the healing capacity of the epithelium are important in determining functional and biochemical abnormalities in active Crohn's disease. Changes may be dependent on the type and number of immune cells involved in the inflammatory process. © 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Dietary lifestyle is relevant for prevention and treatment of various colorectal conditions. Colorectal disorders have significant morbidity and mortality in a western-style community, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colorectal cancer, haemorrhoids, constipation and diverticular disease. This review addresses how bowel health can be maintained, what foods and dietary lifestyles are associated with risk for disease and what foods are of real value in management. Bowel health is that state where the individual is satisfied with defaecation, the diet does not create undue risk for disease and lumenal contents maintain an intact and functional mucosa. Bowel health depends on a healthy dietary lifestyle, but in particular on an adequate intake of non-digestable dietary polysaccharide. Diet influences biology in part by altering the lumenal environment. Effects such as high butyrate levels, lowered pH, a predominance of 'healthy'over 'unhealthy' bacteria, rapid intestinal transit, high faecal bulk, a non-leaky epithelial barrier, adsorption of dietary carcinogens by fibre, low bile salt concentrations, reduced generation of toxic bile salts or protein derivatives and provision of certain bioactive substances are seen as beneficial. Diet influences future risk for colorectal cancer (vegetables, animal fats, polysaccharides amongst others) and for diverticular disease (fibre). Adequate fibre and resistant starch can improve constipation and anorectal conditions such as fissure and haemorrhoids. The role of diet in managing patients with IBS is complex. Fibre may worsen symptoms in severe cases of IBS, diverticular disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Certain carbohydrates of limited digestibility/absorbability, such as lactose, fructose and sorbitol, can precipitate IBS symptoms. Low fat, high fibre diets may reduce recurrence of colorectal adenomas. Diet has a significant role to play in colorectal disorders.

AB  - An intestinal permeability test analyzing the differential urinary elimination of lactulose and mannitol orally ingested at the same dosage was carried out first in fasting condition, then combined with specific food ingestion, in 17 children with clinical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Foods were selected based on a suggestive clinical history or on a positive radioaller-gosorbent or prick test. Comparison of the results with those of a control population reported in a previous study showed that in nine IBS patients, specific food ingestion was associated with a modification of intestinal permeability. The nine children all had a personal and/or familial history of allergy and/or raised total IgE. The symptoms disappeared in the nine patients after food exclusion either alone (seven patients) or together with further treatment by cromolyn (two patients). We conclude that, at least in some children, symptoms of IBS may be related to food hypersensitivity. © 1990 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

AB  - Background: Calprotectin is released from neutrophils and monocytes, and increased calprotectin levels in stool may serve as a marker of intestinal inflammation. Intestinal permeability is increased in inflammatory bowel diseases, especially in Crohn disease. We studied the relationship between intestinal permeability and calprotectin concentration in intestinal lavage fluid in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: Thirty-eight patients were examined; 17 had Crohn disease; 3, ulcerative colitis; and 18, irritable bowel syndrome. Intestinal lavage was performed by means of a nasojejunal tube positioned by gastroduodenoscopy. By means of a peristaltic pump 2 1 isotonic polyethylene glycol solution (MW, 3350) containing 50 μCi51 Cr-labelled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were administered through the tube over a period of 40 min. The first clear fluid passed per rectum was collected and analysed for calprotectin levels with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Urine was collected for 5 h and analysed for gamma radioactivity. 51Cr-EDTA excretion in urine was expressed as percentage of dose administered (that is, intestinal permeability). Results: Both intestinal permeability and calprotectin concentration were significantly higher in patients with IBD than in patients with functional conditions. In Crohn disease the values depended on disease activity but not on whether the disease was located in the small or in the large bowel. There was a highly significant correlation between calprotectin concentration in gut lavage fluid and intestinal permeability (r = 0.79, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The significant correlation between calprotectin concentration in gut lavage fluid and intestinal permeability supports the view that increased intestinal permeability in IBD might at least in part, be a consequence of increased transepithelial migration of neutrophils.

AB  - Intestinal permeability to probe molecules has been shown to correlate closely with the presence or absence of villous atrophy in a jejunal biopsy. The purpose of this study was to establish if there exist groups of patients with functional derangement of intestinal permeability but normal histopathology of the small bowel mucosa. In 135 patients a cellobiose/mannitol permeability test was performed at the same time as jejunal biopsy. Diagnosis included coeliac disease, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, idiopathic diarrhoea, self diagnosed food allergy, atrophic eczema and postinfectious malabsorption. The value of the cellobiose/mannitol test in identifying patients with abnormal jejunal biopsy histopathology was confirmed. The permeability test was abnormal in all 28 patients with partial or subtotal villous atrophy, and also in all 10 in whom there was a high intraepithelial lymphocyte count despite normal villi and crypts. Functional abnormality of the small intestine has not previously been reported in patients with this jejunal biopsy abnormality. Abnormalities of permeability were also found in patients with idiopathic diarrhoea, folate deficiency, postinfectious or traveller's diarrhoea, small bowel Crohn's disease, and atopic eczema. These results show that sugar permeability tests have more potential in clinical investigation that merely serving as screening tests before jejunal biopsy. There are groups of patients without morphological changes in the small bowel in whom intestinal permeability is abnormal.
