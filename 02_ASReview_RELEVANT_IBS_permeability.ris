AB  - Background: In patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), the diarrheal mechanisms are largely unknown, and they were examined in this study on colon biopsies. Methods: Electrophysiological measurements were used for monitoring functional changes in the diarrheic colon specimens. In parallel, tight junction protein expression was analyzed by Western blot and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, and signaling pathway analysis was performed using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. Results: Epithelial resistance was decreased, indicating an epithelial leak flux diarrheal mechanism with a molecular correlate of decreased claudin-1 expression, while induction of active anion secretion and impairment of active sodium absorption via the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, were not detected. The pathway analysis revealed activation of barrier-affecting cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β and IL-4. Conclusions: Barrier dysfunction as a result of epithelial tight junction changes plays a role in IBS-D as a pathomechanism inducing a leak flux type of diarrhea. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Overweight and obesity have been suggested as significant factors in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) development. However, the relationship between overweight/obesity and IBS is unclear. It is known that a modified intestinal barrier, especially the permeability of the small intestine (s-IP), can play a significant role in the pathogenesis of both obesity and IBS. Moreover, dietary interventions are essential for treating both pathologies. We evaluated the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the urinary and circulating markers of GI barrier function and integrity, the markers of intestinal dysbiosis and bacterial translocation, in 40 IBS patients with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) (32 females and 8 males; mean age = 43.5 ± 1.4 years), categorized using their Body Mass Index levels as normal (NW) and overweight (OW). Evaluations were performed before and after 12 weeks of a Low FODMAP Diet (LFD). At the baseline, OW patients showed a significantly higher s-IP than NW. After an LFD, a significant improvement of s-IP in OW patients occurred, along with a significant decrease in markers of epithelial integrity and bacterial translocation. Our findings highlight the close relationship between overweight and the intestinal barrier and support their involvement in IBS-D pathophysiology. Furthermore, the positive role of an LFD in managing overweight IBS-D was highlighted. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Disturbances in the intestinal barrier and gut dysbiosis have been observed in patients with functional bowel diseases. Aims: To investigate the correlation between biomarkers of intestinal barrier disorders at different layers and the severity of symptoms in patients with overlapping diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia (IDFO), as well as with gut microbiota taxa. Methods: This study included 45 patients with IDFO and 16 healthy controls. Endoscopy with biopsy of the duodenum and sigmoid colon (SC) was performed to count intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and mucosal eosinophils (subepithelial layer), assess fatty acid binding protein (FABP; epithelial layer) level, and stain for mucin-2 (MUC-2; pre-epithelial layer). Composition of the gut microbiota was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results: Patients with IDFO exhibited an increase in biomarkers of intestinal barrier disorders at all layers studied. IEL count in the duodenum was correlated with the severity of bloating (r = 0.336; p = 0.024) and, in the SC, was correlated with tenesmus severity (r = 0.303; p = 0.042). FABP-1 level in the SC was correlated with the severity of diarrhea (r = 0.577; p = 0.001), and FABP-5 concentration in the SC was correlated with abdominal distension (r = 0.477; p = 0.010). MUC-2 concentration in the duodenum was correlated with the severity of heartburn (r = 0.572; p = 0.025) and burning sensation in the epigastrium (r = 0.518; p = 0.048). All biomarkers of intestinal barrier permeability were correlated with the abundance of some gut microbiota taxa. Conclusion: Patients with IDFO exhibited disrupted intestinal barrier function in all layers, which was associated with clinical symptom severity and changes in the gut microbiota.

AB  - Background: The underlying pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still unclear. Our aim was to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of diarrhea, constipation, and antigen uptake in mixed-type IBS (IBS-M). Methods: Colonoscopic biopsies were obtained from IBS-M patients. Epithelial transport and barrier function of colonic mucosae were characterized in Ussing chambers using impedance spectroscopy. Mucosal permeability to macromolecules was measured. Western blotting for tight junction (TJ) proteins was performed and their subcellular localization was visualized by confocal microscopy. RNA-sequencing was performed for gene expression and signaling pathway analysis. Results: In IBS-M, epithelial resistance and ENaC-dependent sodium absorption were unchanged, while short-circuit current reflecting chloride secretion was reduced. Concomitantly, epithelial permeability for fluorescein and FITC-dextran-4000 increased. TJ protein expression of occludin decreased, whereas claudins were unaltered. Confocal microscopy revealed the de-localization of tricellulin from tricellular TJs. Involved pathways were detected as proinflammatory cytokine pathways, LPS, PGE2, NGF, and vitamin D. Conclusions: Decreased anion secretion explains constipation in IBS-M, while ion permeability and sodium absorption were unaltered. Reduced occludin expression resulted in the delocalization of tricellulin from the tricellular TJ, leading to increased macromolecular permeability that contributes to antigen influx into the mucosa and perpetuates a low-grade inflammatory process. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder that affects the large intestine, which encompasses several symptoms including, but not limited to, abdominal pain, bloating and dysmotility. In particular, IBS associated with constipation (IBS-C) is characterized by hard and dry stools and inadequate evacuation and difficulty in defecation. Although several drugs ameliorate intestinal modifications and constipation-associated features, management of IBS is still a challenge. Natural compounds including Xyloglucan and pea protein (XP) and Chia seed powder (CS) are widely known to possess beneficial effects in counteracting several gastrointestinal disorders. Here, we aimed to assess the combined effects of XP and CS to treat constipation-related alterations in an IBS-C rat model. IBS-C was induced by gastric instillation of 2 mL of cold water (0–4 °C) for 14 days and Xiloglucan, Pea protein and Chia seeds (XP + CS) treatment was orally administered for 7 days. On day 22, colon tissues were collected for histological analysis. Our results showed that XP + CS administration attenuated constipation-related parameters by increasing body weight and food and water intake. Upon XP + CS treatment, from day 14 to 22, stool moisture content was restored to physiological level. Colonic tissues from IBS-C rats depicted a disruption of the organ architecture accompanied by edema. Loss of colonic structure was reflected by the marked reduction of tight junction protein expression, Occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). Administration of XP + CS treatment in IBS-C rats significantly ameliorated the colonic histological parameters and exerted a positive effect on barrier integrity by restoring the expression of Occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). Our findings demonstrated that the efficacy of XP and CS in managing constipation in rats is due to the ability of these compounds to form a protective barrier fortifying intestinal integrity and gut functionality. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) patients show altered epithelial permeability and mucosal micro-inflammation in both proximal and distal regions of the intestine. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular events and mechanisms and the clinical role of upper small intestinal alterations. METHODS: Clinical assessment and a jejunal biopsy was obtained in IBS-D patients and healthy subjects. Routine histology and immunohistochemistry was performed in all participants to assess the number of mast cells (MCs) and intraepithelial lymphocytes. RNA in tissue samples was isolated to identify genes showing consistent differential expression by microarray analysis followed by pathway and network analysis in order to identify the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes in IBS-D. Gene and protein expression of tight junction (TJ) components was also assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and confocal microscopy to evaluate the pathways identified by gene expression analysis. RESULTS: The analysis reveals a strong association between the transcript signature of the jejunal mucosa of IBS-D and intestinal permeability, MC biology, and TJ signaling. The expression of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) was reduced in IBS-D at both gene and protein level, with protein redistribution from the TJ to the cytoplasm. Remarkably, our analysis disclosed significant correlation between ZO proteins, MC activation, and clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: IBS-D manifestations are linked to molecular alterations involving MC-related dysregulation of TJ functioning in the jejunal mucosa. © 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Intestinal epithelial barrier function is impaired in irritable bowel syndrome patients. Claudins are highly expressed in cells with tight junctions and are involved in the intestinal epithelial barrier function. The expression pattern of tight junction proteins in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome have not been fully elucidated. We therefore recruited 17 diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients and 20 healthy controls. The expression of the tight junction-related proteins was examined in the ileal, cecal, and rectal mucosa of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients using real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. Claudin-2 expression was high in the ileum of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients. Claudin-2 expression was the same in cecum and rectal mucosa of control and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients. Similarly, the expression of clauidn-1, claudin-7, JAM-A, occludin, and ZO-1 in the ileal, cecal, and rectal mucosa did not change between control and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome samples. Infiltration of eosinophil and mast cells in the mucosa of ileum, cecum and rectum was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining and was not affected by diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Claudin-2 was expressed on the apical side of villi and crypts of ileal mucosal epithelial cells. Clauidn-2 expression is upregulated in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients and may contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. © 2017 JCBN.

AB  - Objectives: Recent studies have suggested that an increased intestinal permeability is involved in the pathophysilogy of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the differential expression of tight junctions (TJs) proteins according to IBS subtypes and symptoms remained unknown. The objective of this study was to study zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, and claudin-1 in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS. Methods: Fifty IBS patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria and 31 controls were included. All types of IBS patients participated with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D, n=19), predominant constipation (IBS-C, n=14), constipation alternating with diarrhea (IBS-A, n=15), or unclassified (IBS-U, n=2). IBS symptom intensity was quantified on 10-cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). TJ proteins (claudin-1, ZO-1, occludin) were quantified by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot, while their localization was determined by immunofluorescence. Results: ZO-1 and occludin expression was lower in IBS patients compared with controls, whereas only a trend for a decrease of claudin-1 was observed. The mRNA levels remained unaffected. In the subgroup analyses, occludin and claudin-1 expression was decreased in IBS-D patients but not in IBS-C and IBS-A patients. The subcellular distribution of these three proteins was altered in IBS-C and IBS-D patients. Occludin (r=0.40, P<0.01) and claudin-1 (r=0.46, P<0.01) expression was correlated with the duration of symptoms. The expression of occludin was lower in patients with an abdominal pain intensity higher than 6 on the VAS (P<0.05). Conclusions: Occludin and claudin-1 appeared markedly affected in IBS-D patients. In addition, our results suggest that alteration of TJ proteins may be involved in the initiation of IBS and contribute to visceral hypersensitivity. © 2011 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Background: Studies have shown increased intestinal permeability in irritable bowel syndrome. Validating serum biomarkers for altered intestinal permeability in irritable bowel syndrome will facilitate research and pathophysiology-based therapy. Objective: To measure serum zonulin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and compare with healthy controls and celiac disease. Methods: Serum zonulin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (n = 50), diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (n = 50), celiac disease (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 42). Irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity was measured using the irritable bowel syndrome-symptom severity scale. Results: Patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome had higher zonulin levels compared with healthy controls (p = 0.006 and 0.009 respectively), which was comparable to those with active celiac disease. Although zonulin levels did not correlate with the overall irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity scale, it positively correlated with stool frequency per week (p = 0.03) and dissatisfaction with bowel habits (p = 0.007) in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome had lower intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels compared with celiac patients (p = 0.005 and p = 0.047 respectively). Conclusion: Serum zonulin is upregulated in irritable bowel syndrome and the levels are comparable to those in celiac disease. Zonulin levels correlated with severity of bowel habits in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels in irritable bowel syndrome patients were not increased suggesting no significant increase in enterocyte death. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: Increased intestinal permeability and altered expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins may be implicated in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study aimed to investigate the expression of adherens junction (AJ) protein E-cadherin and TJ proteins zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and claudin (CLD)-1 and associations with IBS symptoms. Methods: Junctional proteins were immunostained in cecal biopsy tissue of Rome II IBS patients (n = 34) comprising both alternating (IBS-A) and diarrhea predominant (IBS-D) subtypes, and controls (n = 12). IBS symptom duration, abdominal pain severity and stool frequency were assessed for IBS patients. Protein expression was determined by immunofluorescence. Key Results: E-cadherin and ZO-1 protein expression was significantly lower (p = 0.03 and p = 0.016, respectively) in the cecal surface epithelium of the IBS group comprising both IBS-A and IBS-D subtypes. CLD-1 expression was not significantly altered compared with controls. On subtype analysis, ZO-1 expression was significantly reduced in both IBS-A and IBS-D compared with controls, whereas E-cadherin was reduced only in IBS-A. Lower E-cadherin expression was associated with longer symptoms duration specifically in IBS-A patients (rs = -0.76, p = 0.004). Reduced E-cadherin associated with abdominal pain severity in the overall IBS group (rs = -0.36, p = 0.041), but this association was unrelated to IBS subtype. Conclusions & Inferences: E-cadherin protein expression in the cecum was significantly lower in IBS-A compared with controls and associated with longstanding symptoms. E-cadherin was further associated with abdominal pain severity in the IBS group overall, but unrelated to IBS subtype. Altered E-cadherin expression may provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS. In this study, comprising IBS-A and IBS-D subtypes, E-cadherin and ZO-1 protein expression was significantly lower in the cecal surface epithelium compared with controls. Furthermore, reduced E-cadherin expressed in the IBS group was associated with more severe abdominal pain, and in IBS-A with longer duration of symptoms. Altered E-cadherin expression may provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Disturbed intestinal epithelial barrier and mucosal micro-inflammation characterize irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Despite intensive research demonstrating ovarian hormones modulation of IBS severity, there is still limited knowledge on the mechanisms underlying female predominance in this disorder. Our aim was to identify molecular pathways involved in epithelial barrier dysfunction and female predominance in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients. Total RNA and protein were obtained from jejunal mucosal biopsies from healthy controls and IBS-D patients meeting the Rome III criteria. IBS severity was recorded based on validated questionnaires. Gene and protein expression profiles were obtained and data integrated to explore biological and molecular functions. Results were validated by western blot. Tight junction signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, regulation of actin-based motility by Rho, and cytoskeleton signaling were differentially expressed in IBS-D. Decreased TESK1-dependent cofilin 1 phosphorylation (pCFL1) was confirmed in IBS-D, which negatively correlated with bowel movements only in female participants. In conclusion, deregulation of cytoskeleton dynamics through TESK1/CFL1 pathway underlies epithelial intestinal dysfunction in the small bowel mucosa of IBS-D, particularly in female patients. Further understanding of the mechanisms involving sex-mediated regulation of mucosal epithelial integrity may have significant preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic implications for IBS. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective To investigate the association between adherens junction proteins E‑cadherin and β‑catenin and tight junction protein claudin‑2 and clinical symptoms in patients with diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS‑D). Methods Cecal biopsy tissues were collected from IBS‑D patients (n=26) according to Rome Ⅲ criterion and healthy controls (n=26). The duration of symptoms, abdominal pain score and mean weekly bowel movements were recorded. Colorectal dilatation combined with restraint stress were applied to establish visceral hypersensitivity rat model. Abdominal contraction reflex (AWR) was applied to assess the visceral sensitivity in rats. The stool frequency within 1 hour was recorded after establishing the rat model. The expression of E‑cadherin、β‑catenin and claudin‑2 were assessed by Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. Intercellular ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Results Compared with the healthy controls, the protein expression of E‑cadherin and β‑catenin in cecal epithelium in IBS‑D patients were significantly lower (P= 0.015 and P=0.005, respectively), while claudin‑2 was significantly higher (P=0.000). Reduced E‑cadherin and β‑catenin expression was associated high abdominal pain score (r=-0.463, P=0.017 and r=-0.407, P= 0.039). The lower expression of β‑catenin was associated with longer duration of symptoms (r=-0.458, P= 0.019). The protein expression of E‑cadherin and ß‑catenin in the cecal epithelium of the visceral hypersensitivity rats were significantly lower (P=0.004 and P=0.003, respectively), while claudin‑2 was significantly higher (P=0.008). Reduced E‑cadherin and ß‑catenin expression was associated high visceral sensitivity in IBS‑D rats (r=- 0.639, P=0.047 and r=- 0.888, P=0.001). Conclusions Intercellular ultrastructure alterations well as cecal β‑catenin and E‑cadherin protein expression decrease and are associated with high abdominal pain score in IBS‑D patients and hypersensitivity rats. β‑catenin is further associated with prolonged duration of symptoms in IBS‑D patients. The expression of E‑cadherin and β‑catenin may play a vital role in visceral sensitivity and intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS‑D. © 2021 Chinese Journal of Geological Hazard and Control.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous condition and defined according to symptoms. Low-grade inflammation has been associated with IBS, particularly that following infection, but whether altered intestinal permeability profiles relate to irritable bowel subtype or onset is uncertain. Our aim was to compare small and large intestinal permeability in various subtypes of IBS to healthy controls. METHODS: Intestinal permeability was measured using 1.8 MBq of 51Cr-EDTA and collecting urine over 24 h; Study 1: patients with diarrhea-predominant postinfectious IBS (N = 15), constipation-predominant IBS (N = 15), and healthy controls (N = 15); Study 2: two groups of diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS), one with a history of onset after acute gastroenteritis (postinfectious) (N = 15) and the other without such a history (nonpostinfectious) (N = 15) both compared with healthy controls (N = 12). RESULTS: Permeability expressed as percentage of total dose excreted in urine (median [inter-quartile range]). Study 1: Proximal small intestinal permeability was increased in postinfectious IBS (0.19 [0.12-0.23]) in contrast to constipated IBS (0.085 [0.043-0.13]) and controls (0.07 [0.035-0.19]) (p = 0.02). IBS patients with eczema, asthma, or hayfever had increased proximal small intestinal permeability compared with IBS patients without atopy (p = 0.02). Study 2: Small intestinal permeability was greater in nonpostinfectious diarrhea-predominant IBS (0.84 [0.69-1.49]) compared with postinfectious IBS (0.43 [0.29-0.63], p = 0.028) or controls (0.27 [0.2-0.39]), p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Small intestinal permeability is frequently abnormal in diarrhea-predominant IBS. Those without a history of infectious onset appear to have a more severe defect. © 2006 by Am.

AB  - Background:Recent studies showed that patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) had an increased intestinal permeability as well as a decreased expression of tight junctions. Glutamine, the major substrate of rapidly dividing cells, is able to modulate intestinal permeability and tight junction expression in other diseases. We aimed to evaluate, ex vivo, glutamine effects on tight junction proteins, claudin-1 and occludin, in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS-D. Materials and Methods: Twelve patients with IBS-D, diagnosed with the Rome III criteria, were included (8 women/4 men, aged 40.7 ± 6.9 years). Colonic biopsy specimens were collected and immediately incubated for 18 hours in culture media with increasing concentrations of glutamine from 0.6-10 mmol/L. Claudin-1 and occludin expression was then measured by immunoblot, and concentrations of cytokines were assessed by multiplex technology. Claudin-1 expression was affected by glutamine (P <.05, analysis of variance). In particularly, 10 mmol/L glutamine increased claudin-1 expression compared with 0.6 mmol/L glutamine (0.47 ± 0.04 vs 0.33 ± 0.03, P <.05). In contrast, occludin expression was not significantly modified by glutamine. Interestingly, glutamine effect was negatively correlated to claudin-1 (Pearson r = -0.83, P <.001) or occludin basal expression (Pearson r = -0.84, P <.001), suggesting that glutamine had more marked effects when tight junction protein expression was altered. Cytokine concentrations in culture media were not modified by glutamine treatment. Conclusion: Glutamine increased claudin-1 expression in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS-D. In addition, glutamine effect seems to be dependent on basal expression of tight junction proteins. © 2015 The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) are poorly understood, but increased intestinal permeability is thought to contribute to symptoms. A recent clinical trial of gluten-free diet (GFD) demonstrated symptomatic improvement, relative to gluten-containing diet (GCD), which was associated with reduced intestinal permeability in non-celiac disease IBS-D patients. The aim of this study was to characterize intestinal epithelial tight junction composition in IBS-D before and after dietary gluten challenge. Biopsies from 27 IBS-D patients (13 GFD and 14 GCD) were examined by H&E staining and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC), MLC kinase, claudin-2, claudin-8 and claudin-15. Diet-induced changes were assessed and correlated with urinary mannitol excretion (after oral administration). In the small intestine, epithelial MLC phosphorylation was increased or decreased by GCD or GFD, respectively, and this correlated with increased intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Colonocyte expression of the paracellular Na + channel claudin-15 was also markedly augmented following GCD challenge (P<0.05). Conversely, colonic claudin-2 expression correlated with reduced intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Claudin-8 expression was not affected by dietary challenge. These data show that alterations in MLC phosphorylation and claudin-15 and claudin-2 expression are associated with gluten-induced symptomatology and intestinal permeability changes in IBS-D. The results provide new insight into IBS-D mechanisms and can explain permeability responses to gluten challenge in these patients. © 2017 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/Aims: Defective epithelial barrier has been implicated in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate gut permeability in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis (UC) and in patients with IBS. Methods: IBS patients of the diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) and of the constipation-predominant subgroup (IBS-C), patients with inactive UC and healthy subjects were enrolled. Gut permeability was evaluated by measuring 24-hour urine excretion of orally administered 51Cr-EDTA. Clinical symptoms were evaluated in IBS-D patients and correlated to colonic permeability. Results: There was a significant decrease in the proximal small intestinal permeability in IBS-C patients compared to controls (0.26 ± 0.05 vs. 0.63 ± 0.1%; p < 0.05). Distal small intestinal permeability showed no significant difference in the studied group of patients compared to controls. Colonic permeability of IBS-D and inactive UC patients was significantly increased compared to controls (2.68 ± 0.35 and 3.74 ± 0.49 vs. 1.04 ± 0.18%; p < 0.05, p < 0.001). Colonic permeability of IBS-D patients correlated with stool frequency. Conclusions: Elevated gut permeability is localized to the colon both in IBS-D and in inactive UC patients. © 2011 S.

AB  - Background: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder whose pathogenesis is not completely understood. Its high prevalence and the considerable effects on quality of life make IBS a disease with high social cost. Recent studies suggest that low grade mucosal immune activation, increased intestinal permeability and the altered host-microbiota interactions that modulate innate immune response, contribute to the pathophysiology of IBS. However, the understanding of the precise molecular pathophysiology remains largely unknown. Methodology and Findings: In this study our objective was to evaluate the TLR expression as a key player in the innate immune response, in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients classified into the three main subtypes (with constipation, with diarrhea or mixed). TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression was assessed by real time RT-PCR while TLRs protein expression in intestinal epithelial cells was specifically assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Mucosal inflammatory cytokine production was investigated by the multiplex technology. Here we report that the IBS-Mixed subgroup displayed a significant up-regulation of TLR2 and TLR4 in the colonic mucosa. Furthermore, these expressions were localized in the epithelial cells, opening new perspectives for a potential role of epithelial cells in host-immune interactions in IBS. In addition, the increased TLR expression in IBS-M patients elicited intracellular signaling pathways resulting in increased expression of the mucosal proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL1β. Conclusions: Our results provide the first evidence of differential expression of TLR in IBS patients according to the disease subtype. These results offer further support that microflora plays a central role in the complex pathophysiology of IBS providing novel pharmacological targets for this chronic gastrointestinal disorder according to bowel habits. © 2012 Belmonte et al.

AB  - Background Altered intestinal permeability in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) has been reported in some studies. Aims The study aimed to investigate the altered intestinal permeability and its associated clinical characteristics and RNA expression profiles in IBS-D. Methods We stratified IBS-D patients into two groups according to the P95 value of the permeability in controls. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were evaluated, and two biopsy cases from each of the two groups were selected for the RNA-seq analysis. Results IBS-D patients had a significant increase in the small intestinal permeability compared with controls [0.0245 (0.0229) median (interquartile range)] versus 0.0156 (0.0098), P = 0.010), but no significant difference was found in the colonic permeability [23.286 (10.470) versus 21.650 (6.650), P = 0.574]. The IBS-D patients with increased small intestinal permeability had worse psychological effects (P = 0.027) and quality of life (P = 0.044). Analysis of RNA-seq data revealed 185 genes differentially expressed, many of which were related to mucosal inflammation and immunity. Conclusions Small intestinal permeability, but not colonic permeability, is increased in IBS-D patients. IBS-D patients with increased small intestinal permeability tend to be more severely impaired in terms of psychological effects and quality of life, and analysis of RNA-seq data reveals that increased small intestinal permeability is related to mucosal inflammation and immunity. © 2016 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

AB  - Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play a vital role in the homeostatic regulation of intestinal barrier integrity. We aimed to investigate the physiological role of BDNF in maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier using postinflammatory irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) mice and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms using intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Methods: Postinflammatory-IBS mice were induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and allowed to recover for 28 days. Frequency of defecation, fecal water content, colonic epithelial integrity and expressions of BDNF and tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin, ZO-1, claudin-1, claudin-2) of the PI-IBS mice were investigated. Based on the results of animal studies, we further performed RT-PCR and Western blots to assess how BDNF stimulation and BDNF knockdown impacted TJ proteins in the ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells. Key Results: Water content of stools was significantly increased in the PI-IBS mice compared with controls. Colonic mucosa from the PI-IBS mice displayed epithelial barrier defects and exhibited increased protein expressions of BDNF and claudin-2 and decreased protein expressions of occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-1. Furthermore, a siRNA against BDNF in the ht-29 cells could effectively suppress BDNF gene and protein expressions, and subsequently reduce TJ gene and protein levels. When the ht-29 cells were incubated with different doses of exogenous BDNF, significant increases of occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-1 and decreases of claudin-2 protein were observed. Conclusions & Inferences: BDNF may play a role in regulating intestinal epithelial barrier via affecting the expression of TJ proteins. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background/Aims: Although mucosal mast cell tryptase is known to significantly increase intestinal permeability, the relationship between mucosal mast cells and intestinal permeability remains unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation among intestinal permeability, tryptase activity and mucosal mast cell count. Methods Rectal biopsies from 16 patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and 7 normal subjects were assessed for tryptase activity and macromolecular permeability using horseradish peroxidase in Ussing chambers. In addition, mucosal mast cell levels were immunohistochemically quantified via image analysis. Results Rectal biopsy of tissues from IBS-D patients showed significantly increased permeability compared with those from normal controls (0.644 ± 0.08 and 0.06 ± 0.00 ng/2 hr/mm2, P < 0.01). Tryptase activity was also substantially higher in rectal biopsy samples from IBS-D patients than those from normal controls (0.86 ± 0.18 and 0.28 ± 0.04 mU/mg protein, P < 0.05). Mucosal mast cell counts were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). However, correlation analysis revealed that only mucosal mast cell count was significantly correlated with intestinal permeability in IBS-D patients (r = 0.558, P < 0.05). Conclusions This study demonstrated a positive correlation between the number of mucosal mast cells and intestinal permeability, suggesting that mucosal mast cells play an important role for increased intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D. © 2013 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

AB  - Background: Growing evidence suggests that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have increased intestinal permeability. In addition, mucosal soluble mediators are involved in the pathophysiology of pain in IBS. We aimed to investigate (1) paracellular permeability in colonic biopsies of patients with IBS; and (2) the ability of soluble factors from colonic biopsies to reproduce these alterations in vitro. Methods: Paracellular permeability in colonic biopsies of healthy subjects and patients with IBS was measured by mounting the biopsies in Ussing chambers. Cleared supernatant (SUP) of the culture from colonic biopsies was collected and applied to Caco-2 cells for 48 h. Paracellular permeability and transepithelial resistance (TER) were evaluated. mRNA expression of the tight junction proteins, zonula occludens (Z0)-1 and occludin, was assessed in colonic biopsies. Abdominal pain was assessed using a validated questionnaire. Results: Permeability of colonic biopsies was significantly higher in patients with IBS compared to healthy subjects. These changes were associated with significantly lower expression of ZO-1 mRNA in biopsies of IBS as compared to healthy subjects. Compared to healthy subjects, SUP of IBS markedly reduced TER and significantly increased permeability in Caco-2 cells. SUP of IBS patients induced a significant decrease of ZO-1 mRNA in Caco-2 as compared to healthy subjects. SUP-induced increased paracellular permeability correlated with the severity of abdominal pain. Conclusions: Our study shows that colonic soluble mediators are able to reproduce functional (permeability) and molecular (ZO-1 mRNA expression) alterations observed in IBS patients. These findings might pave the way both to identify novel biomarkers as well as new therapeutic targets in IBS.

AB  - Background and Aims Patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) appear to have increased intestinal permeability; it has been suggested that activation of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) receptors is responsible for this alteration. The aims of this study are to evaluate (1) if rectal (large bowel) permeability is increased in IBS-D and (2) if tryptase plays a critical role in the altered permeability. Methods Rectal biopsies from 20 patients with IBS-D and 30 subjects without the condition (normal controls) were assessed for macromolecular permeability using horseradish peroxidase in Ussing chambers in the basal state and after addition of drugs to the basolateral side. Reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using colonic biopsy tissues from patients with IBS-D and normal subjects. Results When tryptase was added to the basolateral (not mucosal) side of normal rectal biopsy tissues, permeability appeared to be proportional to the increase in tryptase concentration (P ≤ 0.05) and was abolished by the addition of tryptase inhibitor (100 μM nafamostat; 1.568 ± 0.874 ng/2 h/mm2 to 0.766 ± 0.661 ng/2 h/mm2, n = 14, respectively, P ≤ 0.01). Intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D was significantly increased compared with controls (0.848 ± 0.0.600 ng/2 h/mm2, n = 21, P ≤ 0.01). Nafamostat significantly reduced the enhanced permeability in IBS-D (0.934 ± 0.589 ng/2 h/mm2 to 0.247 ± 0.263 ng/ 2 h/mm2, n = 14, respectively, P ≤ 0.05). Transcription levels of PAR2 measured by RT-PCR did not differ between IBS-D and normal subjects. Conclusion Tryptase seems to play an important role in the control of human colonic mucosal permeability, and enhanced tryptase activity was responsible for the increased permeability of rectal mucosa in IBS patients. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - Objective Recently, the authors demonstrated altered gene expression in the jejunal mucosa of diarrhoeapredominant irritable bowel syndrome patients (IBS-D); specifically, the authors showed that genes related to mast cells and the intercellular apical junction complex (AJC) were expressed differently than in healthy subjects. The aim of the authors here was to determine whether these alterations are associated with structural abnormalities in AJC and their relationship with mast cell activation and IBS-D clinical manifestations. Design A clinical assessment and a jejunal biopsy were obtained in IBS-D patients (n=45) and healthy subjects (n=30). Mucosal mast cell number and activation were determined by quantifying CD117+ cells/hpf and tryptase expression, respectively. Expression and distribution of AJC specific proteins were evaluated by western blot and confocal microscopy. AJC ultrastructure was assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Results Compared with healthy subjects, IBS-D patients exhibited: (a) increased mast cell counts and activation; (b) increased protein expression of claudin-2, reduced occludin phosphorylation and enhanced redistribution from the membrane to the cytoplasm; and (c) increased myosin kinase expression, reduced myosin phosphatase and, consequently, enhanced phosphorylation of myosin. These molecular alterations were associated with ultrastructural abnormalities at the AJC, specifically, perijunctional cytoskeleton condensation and enlarged apical intercellular distance. Moreover, AJC structural alterations positively correlated both with mast cell activation and clinical symptoms. Conclusion The jejunal mucosa of IBS-D patients displays disrupted apical junctional complex integrity associated with mast cell activation and clinical manifestations. These results provide evidence for the organic nature of IBS-D, a heretofore model disease of functional gastrointestinal disorders.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder in which the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood; however, increased intestinal permeability in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients has been reported. Here we demonstrate that diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) patients display increased intestinal permeability. We have also found that increased intestinal membrane permeability is associated with visceral and thermal hypersensitivity in this subset of D-IBS patients. We evaluated 54 D-IBS patients and 22 controls for intestinal membrane permeability using the lactulose/mannitol method. All subjects ingested 5 g of lactulose and 2 g of mannitol in 100 ml of water after which their urine was collected. We also evaluated the mean mechanical visual analogue scale (M-VAS) pain rating to nociceptive thermal and visceral stimulation in all subjects. All study participants also completed the FBDSI scale. Approximately 39% of diarrhea-predominant IBS patients had increased intestinal membrane permeability as measured by the lactulose/mannitol ratio. These IBS patients also demonstrated higher M-VAS pain intensity reading scale. Interestingly, the IBS patients with hypersensitivity and increased intestinal permeability had a higher FBDSI score (100.8 ± 5.4) than IBS patients with normal membrane permeability and sensitivity (51.6 ± 12.7) and controls (6.1 ± 5.6) (p < 0.001). A subset of D-IBS patients had increased intestinal membrane permeability that was associated with an increased FBDSI score and increased hypersensitivity to visceral and thermal nociceptive pain stimuli. Thus, increased intestinal membrane permeability in D-IBS patients may lead to more severe IBS symptoms and hypersensitivity to somatic and visceral stimuli. © 2009 International Association for the Study of Pain.

AB  - Objectives: Impaired intestinal barrier function has been demonstrated in the pathophysiology of diarrheapredominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). This study aimed to describe the intestinal ultrastructural findings in the intestinal mucosal layer of IBS-D patients. Methods: In total, 10 healthy controls and 10 IBS-D patients were analyzed in this study. The mucosa of each patient's rectosigmoid colon was first assessed by confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE); next, biopsied specimens of these sites were obtained. Intestinal tissues of IBS-D patients and healthy volunteers were examined to observe cellular changes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: CLE showed no visible epithelial damage or inflammatory changes in the colonic mucosa of IBS-D compared with healthy volunteers. On transmission electron microscopic examination, patients with IBS-D displayed a larger apical intercellular distance with a higher proportion of dilated (>20 nm) intercellular junctional complexes, which was indicative of impaired mucosal integrity. In addition, microvillus exfoliation, extracellular vesicle as well as increased presence of multivesicular bodies were visible in IBS-D patients. Single epithelial cells appeared necrotic, as characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization, cytoplasmic swelling, and presence of autolysosome. A significant association between bowel habit, frequency of abdominal pain, and enlarged intercellular distance was found. Conclusion: This study showed ultrastructural alterations in the architecture of intestinal epithelial cells and intercellular junctional complexes in IBS-D patients, potentially representing a pathophysiological mechanism in IBS-D. © 2019 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

AB  - OBJECTIVES:The objective of this study was to investigate how mast cell tryptase may influence intestinal permeability and tight junction (TJ) proteins in vitro and explore translation to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).METHODS:We investigate. The effect of: (1) tryptase on Caco-2 monolayers, (2) mast cell degranulation in a Caco-2/human mast cell-1 (HMC-1) co-culture model, (3) mast cell degranulation±tryptase inhibition with nafamostat mesilate (NM). Epithelial integrity was assessed by transepithelial resistance (TER), permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The expression of junctional proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), claudin-1 (CLD-1), CLD-2, CLD-3, occludin and E-cadherin was determined by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Based o. The in vitro results, we further assessed JAM-A expression in biopsy tissue (cecum) from 34 IBS patients, 12 controls, and 8 inflammatory controls using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and explored associations between JAM-A and IBS symptoms.RESULTS: ptase disrupted epithelial integrity in Caco-2 monolayers as shown by a significant decrease in TER, an increase in permeability to FITC-dextran, and a decrease i. The expression of junctional proteins JAM-A, CLD-1, and ZO-1 within 24 h. Correspondingly, i. The Caco-2/HMC-1 co-culture model we showed a significant decrease in TER, an increase in permeability to FITC-dextran, an. The presence of open TJs (TEM) in response to mast cell degranulation within 24 h. In this co-culture model, mast cell degranulation significantly decreased JAM-A and CLD-1 protein expression at 24 h. Tryptase inhibition (NM) significantly reduce. The effect of mast cell degranulation o. The junctional protein JAM-A, TER, and FITC-dextran flux. In IBS, epithelial JAM-A protein expression was significantly reduced in IBS tissue compared with controls. Lower JAM-A expression was associated with more severe abdominal pain (r s =-0.69, P=0.018) and longer duration of symptoms (r s =-0.7, P=0.012) in IBS-alternating subtype.CONCLUSIONS:uced JAM-A expression in vitro appears to contribute t. The underlying mechanisms of altered epithelial integrity in response to tryptase released from degranulating mast cells. In IBS, JAM-A expression was significantly reduced i. The cecal epithelium and associated with abdominal pain severity. JAM-A may provide new insights int. The underlying mechanisms in IBS.

AB  - Background/Aims: Small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a frequent finding in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Many patients with IBS also have abnormal intestinal permeability, which is probably due to low-grade inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. Our aim was to verify the relationship between SIBO and small-intestinal permeability in IBS patients. Methods: A cohort of 38 IBS patients (20 women and 18 men; age range 16-70 years; mean age 40.2 years) with symptoms that fulfilled Rome-II criteria, and 12 healthy controls (5 women and 7 men; age range 25-52 years; mean age: 37.8 years) were recruited. All subjects underwent lactulose breath tests (LBTs) and intestinal permeability tests using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350/400 retrieval ratio. Results: A positive LBT was found in 18.4% (7/38) of patients with IBS and 8.3% (1/12) of control subjects. Intestinal permeability was significantly increased in patients with IBS compared with the normal controls (0.82±0.09 vs 0.41±0.05 [mean±SD], respectively; p<0.05). However, the intestinal permeability did not differ significantly between IBS patients with a positive LBT and those with a negative LBT (0.90±0.13 and 0.80±0.11, respectively; p>0.05). Conclusions: Intestinal permeability was increased in patients with IBS, but this finding did not correlated with the occurrence of SIBO.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of brain-gut interaction characterised by abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. In the diarrhoea subtype (IBS-D), altered epithelial barrier and mucosal immune activation are associated with clinical manifestations. We aimed to further evaluate plasma cells and epithelial integrity to gain understanding of IBS-D pathophysiology. One mucosal jejunal biopsy and one stool sample were obtained from healthy controls and IBS-D patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms, stress, and depression scores were recorded. In the jejunal mucosa, RNAseq and gene set enrichment analyses were performed. A morphometric analysis by electron microscopy quantified plasma cell activation and proximity to enteric nerves and glycocalyx thickness. Immunoglobulins concentration was assessed in the stool. IBS-D patients showed differential expression of humoral pathways compared to controls. Activation and proximity of plasma cells to nerves and IgG concentration were also higher in IBS-D. Glycocalyx thickness was lower in IBS-D compared to controls, and this reduction correlated with plasma cell activation, proximity to nerves, and clinical symptoms. These results support humoral activity and loss of epithelial integrity as important contributors to gut dysfunction and clinical manifestations in IBS-D. Additional studies are needed to identify the triggers of these alterations to better define IBS-D pathophysiology. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder with multifactorial pathophysiology. Intestinal barrier may be altered, especially in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Several mediators may contribute to increased intestinal permeability in IBS. Aim We aimed to assess effects of tryptase and LPS on in vitro permeability using a 3- dimensional cell model after basolateral cell exposure. Furthermore, we assessed the extent to which these mediators in IBS plasma play a role in intestinal barrier function. Materials and Methods Caco-2 cells were grown in extracellular matrix to develop into polarized spheroids and were exposed to tryptase (10 - 50 mU), LPS (1 - 50 ng/mL) and two-fold diluted plasma samples of 7 patients with IBS-D, 7 with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and 7 healthy controls (HC). Barrier function was assessed by the flux of FITC-dextran (FD4) using live cell imaging. Furthermore, plasma tryptase and LPS were determined. Results Tryptase (20 and 50 mU) and LPS (6.25 - 50 ng/mL) significantly increased Caco-2 permeability versus control (all P< 0.05). Plasma of IBS-D only showed significantly elevated median tryptase concentrations (7.1 [3.9 - 11.0] vs. 4.2 [2.2 - 7.0] vs. 4.2 [2.5 - 5.9] μg/mL; P<0.05) and LPS concentrations (3.65 [3.00 - 6.10] vs. 3.10 [2.60-3.80] vs. 2.65 [2.40 - 3.40] EU/ml; P< 0.05) vs. IBS-C and HC. Also, plasma of IBS-D increased Caco-2 permeability versus HC (0.14450 ± 0.00472 vs. 0.00021 ± 0.00003; P < 0.001), which was attenuated by selective inhibition of tryptase and LPS (P< 0.05). Conclusion Basolateral exposure of spheroids to plasma of IBS-D patients resulted in a significantly increased FD4 permeation, which was partially abolished by selective inhibition of tryptase and LPS. These findings point to a role of systemic tryptase and LPS in the epithelial barrier alterations observed in patients with IBS-D.  © 2015 Ludidi et al.

AB  - Background and aims Altered intestinal barrier is associated with immune activation and clinical symptoms in diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Increased mucosal antigen load may induce specific responses; however, local antibody production and its contribution to IBS aetiopathogenesis remain undefined. This study evaluated the role of humoral activity in IBS-D. Methods A single mucosal jejunal biopsy, luminal content and blood were obtained from healthy volunteers (H; n=30) and IBS-D (n=49; Rome III criteria) participants. Intraepithelial lymphocytes, mast cells, B lymphocytes and plasma cells were studied by imaging techniques. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis were assessed by microarray and PCR techniques. Blood and luminal immunoglobulins (Igs) were quantified. Gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory atopy and stress and depression were also recorded. Results Patients with IBS-D showed a higher number and activation of mucosal B lymphocytes and plasma cells (p<0.05). Mast cell density was increased in patients with IBS-D (non-atopic) and in close proximity to plasma cells ( p<0.05). Microarray profiling identified differential humoral activity in IBS-D, involving proliferation and activation of B lymphocytes and Igs production ( p<0.001). Mucosal humoral activity was higher in IBS-D, with upregulation of germline transcripts and Ig genes (1.3-fold1.7-fold increase; p<0.05), and increased IgG+ cells and luminal IgG compared with H ( p<0.05), with no differences in blood. Biological markers of humoral activity correlated positively with bowel movements, stool form and depression. Conclusions Enhanced small bowel humoral immunity is a distinctive feature of IBS-D. Mucosal Ig production contributes to local inflammation and clinical manifestations in IBS-D.

AB  - Background: Destruction of the intestinal mucosal barrier and visceral hypersensitivity are main pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The study aimed to establish a rat model of visceral hypersensitivity and explore mechanisms involved the changes of the intestinal barrier protein expression and intestinal flora. Methods: A rat model of visceral hypersensitivity was established and evaluated using abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores, colonic paracellular permeability, and gastrointestinal motility. The expression of tight junction proteins, aquaporin proteins (AQPs), phosphorylated ERK, and proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) was determined. The intestinal microflora was evaluated by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Key results: In model rats, AWR score and fecal water content were significantly increased, gastrointestinal motilities were disorder and characterized by an inhibition of gastric motility and an enhancement of small intestinal and colonic movement. The expressions of colonic occludin, ZO-1, AQP3, and AQP8 were decreased but claudin-2 and claudin-4 were markedly increased. Imbalance of intestinal flora appeared and showed an obvious decrease of Lactobacillus and an increase of Clostridiales_bacterium. Additionally, the total serine protease activity in feces, the expressions of PAR2 and phosphorylated ERK in the colon tissues were increased significantly. Conclusion and inferences: The model rats of visceral hypersensitivity possess the decreased expression of occludin, ZO-1, AQP3, AQP8, and the increased expression of claudin-2 and claudin-4, meanwhile develop an imbalance of intestinal flora which probably increase serine protease activity, thereby activating the PAR2/ERK signaling and causing the intestinal barrier disorder. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The present study aimed to explore the correlation between cytokine expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF.-α), interleukin (IL).-8 and IL.-10 with occludin production, abdominal symptoms and psychological factors in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.-associated diarrhea (IBS.-D). A total of 42 IBS.-D patients and 20 healthy controls were included, which were recruited from QiLu Hospital in China. ELISA and immunohistochemical analysis were performed for evaluating the cytokines (TNF.-α, IL.-8 and IL.-10) and occludin protein levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of all subjects. In addition, the abdominal symptoms and psychological status were assessed in IBS.-D patients. Levels of TNF.-α and IL.-8 in the PBMCs of patients with IBS.D were significantly higher than those in the controls (P<0.001 and P=0.007, respectively), while IL.-10 levels were significantly reduced in patients with IBS.-D (P=0.047). Occludin production was significantly reduced in patients with IBS.-D as compared with that in the controls (P<0.001). In patients with IBS.-D, levels of TNF.-α and IL.-8 were negatively correlated with occludin levels (r=0.34, P=0.028; r=0.52, P<0.001, respectively). IL.-10 showed a negative correlation with occludin production (r=0.05, P=0.748). Furthermore, TNF.-α, IL.8 and IL.10 levels were significantly correlated with symptoms scores (r=0.74, P<0.001; r=0.55, P<0.001; r=0.80, P<0.001, respectively) in patients with IBS.-D. Within the IBS.-D group, TNF.-α expression was significantly increased in patients with a self.rating depression scale (SDS) score.50 (P=0.004) as compared with that in patients with an SDS score <50. Furthermore, IL.8 was significantly increased in IBS.D patients with a self.-rating anxiety scale (SAS) or SDS score.50 (P=0.016, P=0.008, respectively) as compared with that in patients scoring <50. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that in IBS.-D, an imbalance of cytokine production evoked colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction, abdominal symptoms and psychological disorders.

AB  - Objective Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in controlling intestinal epithelial barrier function partly by modulating the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins. We have previously shown differential messenger RNA (mRNA) expression correlated with ultrastructural abnormalities of the epithelial barrier in patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). However, the participation of miRNAs in these differential mRNA-associated findings remains to be established. Our aims were (1) to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in the small bowel mucosa of patients with IBS-D and (2) to explore putative target genes specifically involved in epithelial barrier function that are controlled by specific dysregulated IBS-D miRNAs. Design Healthy controls and patients meeting Rome III IBS-D criteria were studied. Intestinal tissue samples were analysed to identify potential candidates by: (a) miRNA-mRNA profiling; (b) miRNA-mRNA pairing analysis to assess the co-expression profile of miRNA-mRNA pairs; (c) pathway analysis and upstream regulator identification; (d) miRNA and target mRNA validation. Candidate miRNA-mRNA pairs were functionally assessed in intestinal epithelial cells. Results IBS-D samples showed distinct miRNA and mRNA profiles compared with healthy controls. TJ signalling was associated with the IBS-D transcriptional profile. Further validation of selected genes showed consistent upregulation in 75% of genes involved in epithelial barrier function. Bioinformatic analysis of putative miRNA binding sites identified hsa-miR-125b-5p and hsa-miR-16 as regulating expression of the TJ genes CGN (cingulin) and CLDN2 (claudin-2), respectively. Consistently, protein expression of CGN and CLDN2 was upregulated in IBS-D, while the respective targeting miRNAs were downregulated. In addition, bowel dysfunction, perceived stress and depression and number of mast cells correlated with the expression of hsa-miR-125b-5p and hsa-miR-16 and their respective target proteins. Conclusions Modulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier function in IBS-D involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. These molecular mechanisms include miRNAs as master regulators in controlling the expression of TJ proteins and are associated with major clinical symptoms. © 2017 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - Background: The role of protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) in the pathogenesis of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not well defined. Aims: To investigate the role of PAR-2-mediated visceral hypersensitivity in a post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) mouse model. Methods: T. spiralis-infected PI-IBS mouse model was used. Fecal serine protease activity and intestinal mast cells were evaluated. Intestinal permeability was assessed by urine lactulose/mannitol ratio, and colonic expressions of PAR-2 and tight junction (TJ) proteins were examined by Western blot. Intestinal immune profile was assessed by measuring Th (T helper) 1/Th2 cytokine expression. Visceral sensitivity was evaluated by abdominal withdrawal reflex in response to colorectal distention. Results: Colonic PAR-2 expression as well as fecal serine protease activity and intestinal mast cell counts were elevated in PI-IBS compared to the control mice. Decreased colonic TJ proteins expression, increased lactulose/mannitol ratio, elevated colonic Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio, and visceral hypersensitivity were observed in PI-IBS compared to the control mice. Administration of PAR-2 agonist in control mice demonstrated similar changes observed in PI-IBS mice, while PAR-2 antagonist normalized the increased intestinal permeability and reduced visceral hypersensitivity observed in PI-IBS mice. Conclusions: PAR-2 activation increases intestinal permeability leading to immune activation and visceral hypersensitivity in PI-IBS mouse model. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background Intestinal permeability has been studied in small groups of IBS patients with contrasting findings. Aims To assess intestinal permeability at different sites of the GI tract in different subtypes of well-characterised IBS patients and healthy controls (HC), and to assess potential confounding factors. Methods IBS patients and HC underwent a multi-sugar test to assess site-specific intestinal permeability. Sucrose excretion and lactulose/rhamnose ratio in 0-5 h urine indicated gastroduodenal and small intestinal permeability, respectively. Sucralose/erythritol ratio in 0-24 h and 5-24 h urine indicated whole gut and colonic permeability, respectively. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between IBS groups and intestinal permeability and to adjust for age, sex, BMI, anxiety or depression, smoking, alcohol intake and use of medication. Results Ninety-one IBS patients, i.e. 37% IBS-D, 23% IBS-C, 33% IBS-M and 7% IBS-U and 94 HC were enrolled. Urinary sucrose excretion was significantly increased in the total IBS group [μmol, median (Q1;Q3): 5.26 (1.82;11.03) vs. 2.44 (0.91;5.85), P < 0.05], as well as in IBS-C and IBS-D vs. HC. However, differences attenuated when adjusting for confounders. The lactulose/rhamnose ratio was increased in IBS-D vs. HC [0.023 (0.013;0.038) vs. 0.014 (0.008;0.025), P < 0.05], which remained significant after adjustment for confounders. No difference was found in 0-24 and 5-24 h sucralose/erythritol ratio between groups. Conclusions Small intestinal permeability is increased in patients with IBS-D compared to healthy controls, irrespective of confounding factors. Adjustment for confounders is necessary when studying intestinal permeability, especially in a heterogeneous disorder such as IBS. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are poorly understood. One mechanism may involve increased intestinal permeability that is reversed with glutamine supplementation. Our goal was to evaluate the expression of glutamine synthetase and its complementary miRNA in blood microvesicles and gut tissues of IBS patients with increased intestinal membrane permeability. Methods: We evaluated 19 diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients and 10 controls for intestinal membrane permeability using the lactulose/mannitol method. miRNA expression was evaluated in blood microvesicles and gut tissue. To further confirm the relationship between miRNA and glutamine synthetase expression, cell culture experiments were conducted. Glutamine synthetase was also evaluated in the gut tissues of patients. Results: A subset of patients with IBS (8/19, 42%) had increased intestinal membrane permeability and decreased glutamine synthetase expression compared to patients with IBS normal membrane permeability, and to controls. Expression of miR-29a was increased in blood microvesicles, small bowel and colon tissues of IBS patients with increased intestinal membrane permeability. Increased intestinal permeability was modulated by miR-29a which has a complementary site in the 3′-UTR of the GLUL gene. Conclusions: The results support the conclusion that GLUL regulates intestinal membrane permeability and miR-29a regulates both GLUL and intestinal membrane permeability. The data suggests that miR-29a effects on intestinal membrane permeability may be due to its regulation of GLUL. Targeting this signalling pathway could lead to a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients with IBS, especially because small molecules that mimic or inhibit miRNA-based mechanisms are readily available.

AB  - Background: Alterations in intestinal permeability regulated by tight junctions (TJs) are associated with immune activation and visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is an important mediator of epithelial TJ. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of MLCK in the pathogenesis of IBS using a post infectious IBS (PI-IBS) mouse model. Methods: Trichinella spiralis-infected PI-IBS mouse model was used. Urine lactulose/mannitol ratio was measured to assess intestinal epithelial permeability. Western blotting was used to evaluate intestinal TJ protein (zonula occludens-1) and MLCK-associated protein expressions. Immune profile was assessed by measuring Th (T helper) 1/Th2 cytokine expression. Visceral sensitivity was determined by abdominal withdrawal reflex in response to colorectal distension. Results: Eight weeks after inoculation with T. spiralis, PI-IBS mice developed decreased pain and volume thresholds during colorectal distention, increased urine lactulose/mannitol ratio, elevated colonic Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio, and decreased zonula occludens-1 expression compared to the control mice. MLCK expression was dramatically elevated in the colonic mucosa of PI-IBS mice compared to the control mice, alongside increased pMLC/MLC and decreased MLCP expression. Administration of MLCK inhibitor and TJ blocker both reversed the increased intestinal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity, and Th1-dominant immune profile in PI-IBS mice. Conclusion: MLCK is a pivotal step in inducing increased intestinal permeability promoting low-grade intestinal immune activation and visceral hypersensitivity in PI-IBS mice. MLCK inhibitor may provide a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of IBS. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Objectives: Diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is characterised by elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the origin of this elevated serine protease activity, (2) to evaluate if it may be sufficient to trigger alterations in colonic paracellular permeability (CPP) and sensitivity, and (3) to examine the role of the proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) activation and signalling cascade in this process. Patients and methods: Faecal enzymatic activities were assayed in healthy subjects and patients with IBS, ulcerative colitis and acute infectious diarrhoea. Following mucosal exposure to supernatants from control subjects and IBS-D patients, electromyographic response to colorectal balloon distension was recorded in wild-type and PAR-2-/- mice, and CPP was evaluated on colonic strips in Ussing chambers. Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and phosphorylated myosin light chain were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: The threefold increase in faecal serine protease activity seen in IBS-D patients compared with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) or infectious diarrhoea is of neither epithelial nor inflammatory cell origin, nor is it coupled with antiprotease activity of endogenous origin. Mucosal application of faecal supernatants from IBS-D patients in mice evoked allodynia and increased CPP by 92%, both of which effects were prevented by serine protease inhibitors and dependent on PAR-2 expression. In mice, colonic exposure to supernatants from IBS-D patients resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and delayed redistribution of ZO-1 in colonocytes. Conclusions: Elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity of IBS-D patients evokes a PAR-2-mediated colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction and subsequent allodynia in mice, suggesting a novel organic background in the pathogenesis of IBS.

AB  - Background: Abnormal gastrointestinal permeability has been linked to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The lactulose-to-mannitol ratio is traditionally used to assess small intestine permeability while sucralose and sucrose are used to assess colonic and gastric permeability respectively. We used a single 4-probe test solution to assess permeability throughout the gastrointestinal tract in IBS patients and healthy controls by measuring the recovery of the probes in urine after ingestion using a modified liquid chromatography mass spectrometry protocol. Methods: Fasting participants (N = 59) drank a permeability test solution (100. ml: sucralose, sucrose, mannitol, and lactulose). Urine was collected over a 5-h period and kept frozen until analysis. Urinary sugar concentrations were measured using a liquid chromatography/triple quadruple mass spectrometer. Results: Colonic permeability was significantly lower in IBS patients when compared to healthy controls (p = 0.011). Gastric and small intestinal permeability did not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the clinical potential of this non-invasive method for assessing alterations in gastrointestinal permeability in patients with IBS. © 2013 .

AB  - Results Microbiota analysis revealed a bacterial profile of 27 genus-like groups, providing an Index of Microbial Dysbiosis (IMD), which significantly separated patient groups and controls. Within this profile, several members of Bacteroidetes phylum were increased 12-fold in patients, while healthy controls had 35-fold more uncultured Clostridia. We showed correlations between the IMD and expression of several host gene pathways, including amino acid synthesis, cell junction integrity and inflammatory response, suggesting an impaired epithelial barrier function in IBS.; Background About 10% of patients with IBS report the start of the syndrome after infectious enteritis. The clinical features of postinfectious IBS (PI-IBS) resemble those of diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). While altered faecal microbiota has been identified in other IBS subtypes, composition of the microbiota in patients with PI-IBS remains uncharacterised.; Objective To characterise the microbial composition of patients with PI-IBS, and to examine the associations between the faecal microbiota and a patient's clinical features.; Design Using a phylogenetic microarray and selected qPCR assays, we analysed differences in the faecal microbiota of 57 subjects from five study groups: patients with diagnosed PI-IBS, patients who 6 months after gastroenteritis had either persisting bowel dysfunction or no IBS symptoms, benchmarked against patients with IBS-D and healthy controls. In addition, the associations between the faecal microbiota and health were investigated by correlating the microbial profiles to immunological markers, quality of life indicators and host gene expression in rectal biopsies.; Conclusions The faecal microbiota of patients with PI-IBS differs from that of healthy controls and resembles that of patients with IBS-D, suggesting a common pathophysiology. Moreover, our analysis suggests a variety of host-microbe associations that may underlie intestinal symptoms, initiated by gastroenteritis.

AB  - Background & Aims: Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) and in the intestinal barrier are putative risk factors for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to identify differentially expressed colonic mucosal miRNAs, their targets in IBS compared to healthy controls (HCs), and putative downstream pathways. Methods: Twenty-nine IBS patients (15 IBS with constipation [IBS-C], 14 IBS with diarrhea [IBS-D]), and 15 age-matched HCs underwent sigmoidoscopy with biopsies. A nCounter array was used to assess biopsy specimen-associated miRNA levels. A false discovery rate (FDR) < 10% was considered significant. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to validate differentially expressed genes. To assess barrier function, trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and dextran flux assays were performed on Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells that were transfected with miRNA-inhibitors or control inhibitors. Protein expression of barrier function associated genes was confirmed using western blots. Results: Four out of 247 miRNAs tested were differentially expressed in IBS compared to HCs (FDR < 10%). Real-time PCR validation suggested decreased levels of miR-219a-5p and miR-338-3p in IBS (P =.026 and P =.004), and IBS-C (P =.02 and P =.06) vs. HCs as the strongest associations. Inhibition of miR-219a-5p resulted in altered expression of proteasome/barrier function genes. Functionally, miR-219a-5p inhibition enhanced the permeability of intestinal epithelial cells as TEER was reduced (25-50%, P <.05) and dextran flux was increased (P <.01). Additionally, inhibition of miR-338-3p in cells caused alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway genes. Conclusion: Two microRNAs that potentially affect permeability and visceral nociception were identified to be altered in IBS patients. MiR-219a-5p and miR-338-3p potentially alter barrier function and visceral hypersensitivity via neuronal and MAPK signaling and could be therapeutic targets in IBS. © 2021 AGA Institute

AB  - Background: The intestinal permeability is increased in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). Aim: To determine the possible efficacy of lactic acid bacteria on the increased intestinal permeability in D-IBS. Methods: Treatment was employed for 4 weeks in a randomized single blind placebo controlled study with 30 D-IBS patients. Patients were given either probiotic fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Longum) or milk beverage containing no bacteria. The clinical symptoms were scored and intestinal permeability was measured by a triple sugar test before and after treatment. Results: Small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of lactulose and mannitol recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). After probiotics treatment, small bowel permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 (0.024) at baseline to 0.023 (0.020) (P = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel permeability was lower than baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.023). However, colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo group at week 4. Treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean global IBS scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 ± 1.05 vs. 7.64 ± 1.24, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Short-term active lactic acid bacteria treatment for D-IBS improved mucosal barrier function. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Background and Aims: Research has increasingly suggested that gut flora plays an important role in the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). Studies of the curative effect of probiotics for IBS have usually been positive but not always. However, the differences of treatment effects and mechanisms among probiotic stains, or mixture of them, are not clear. In this study, we compared the effects of different probiotics (Befidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus or mixture of the three) on intestinal sensation, barrier function and intestinal immunity in PI-IBS mouse model. Methods: PI-IBS model was induced by Trichinella spiralis infection in mice. Different probiotics were administered to mice after 8 weeks infection. Visceral sensitivity was measured by scores of abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and the threshold intensity of colorectal distention. Colonic smooth muscle contractile response was assessed by contraction of the longitudinal muscle strips. Plasma diamine oxidase (DAO) and d-lactate were determined by an enzymatic spectrophotometry. Expression of tight junction proteins and cytokines in ileum were measured by Western blotting. Results: Compared to control mice, PI-IBS mice treated either alone with Befidobacterium or Lactobacillus (but not Streptococcus), or the mixture of the three exhibited not only decreased AWR score and contractile response, but also reduced plasma DAO and D-lactate. These probiotic treatments also suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and IL-17 and promoted the expression of major tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin. The mixture of the three probiotic strains performed better than the individual in up-regulating these tight junction proteins and suppressing IL-17 expression. Conclusions: Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, but not Streptococcus, alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and recovered intestinal barrier function as well as inflammation in PI-IBS mouse model, which correlated with an increase of major tight junction proteins. In addition, Mixture of three species was indicated to be superior to a single one. © 2014 Wang et al.

AB  - There is increasingly convincing evidence supporting the participation of the gut microenvironment in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Studies particularly suggest an interplay between luminal factors (eg, foods and bacteria residing in the intestine), the epithelial barrier, and the mucosal immune system. Decreased expression and structural rearrangement of tight junction proteins in the small bowel and colon leading to increased intestinal permeability have been observed, particularly in postinfectious IBS and in IBS with diarrhea. These abnormalities are thought to contribute to the outflow of antigens through the leaky epithelium, causing overstimulation of the mucosal immune system. Accordingly, subsets of patients with IBS show higher numbers and an increased activation of mucosal immunocytes, particularly mast cells. Immune factors, released by these cells, including proteases, histamine, and prostanoids, participate in the perpetuation of the permeability dysfunction and contribute to the activation of abnormal neural responses involved in abdominal pain perception and changes in bowel habits. All these mechanisms represent new targets for therapeutic approaches in IBS. Probiotics are an attractive therapeutic option in IBS given their recognized safety and by virtue of positive biological effects they can exert on the host. Of importance for the IBS pathophysiology is that preclinical studies have shown that selective probiotic strains exhibit potentially useful properties including anti-inflammatory effects, improvement of mucosal barrier homeostasis, beneficial effects on intestinal microbiota, and a reduction of visceral hypersensitivity. The effect of probiotics on IBS is positive in most randomized, controlled studies, although the gain over the placebo is small. Identifying tailored probiotic approaches for subgroups of IBS patients represents a challenge for the future. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The article presents an analysis of literature data on the violation of intestinal permeability as one of the pathogenetic factors of irritable bowel syndrome. The structure of tight junctions is considered in detail as an impor-tant element of the normal functioning of the intestinal barrier. The researches that previously studied the expression of tight junction components in patients with irritable bowel syndrome were considered. The results of our own study with the evaluation of occludin expression in patients with irritable bowel syndrome are shown. It has been found that the expression of occludin is lower in patients with irritable bowel syndrome compared with healthy individuals. © «Gastroenterology» («Gastroenterologìa»), 2019.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients often experience meal-associated symptoms. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Aim: To determine small intestinal mechanisms of lipid-induced symptoms and rectal hypersensitivity in IBS. Methods: We recruited 26 IBS patients (12 IBS-C, 14 IBS-D) and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). In vivo permeability was assessed using saccharide excretion assay. Rectal sensitivity was assessed using a barostat before and after small bowel lipid infusion; symptoms were assessed throughout. Next, an extended upper endoscopy with probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) was performed with changes induced by lipids. Duodenal and jejunal mucosal biopsies were obtained for transcriptomics. Results: Following lipid infusion, a higher proportion of HV than IBS patients reported no pain, no nausea, no fullness and no urgency (P < 0.05 for all). In a model adjusted for sex and anxiety, IBS-C and IBS-D patients had lower thresholds for first rectal sensation (P = 0.0007) and pain (P = 0.004) than HV. In vivo small intestinal permeability and mean pCLE scores were similar between IBS patients and HV. Post-lipid, pCLE scores were higher than pre-lipid but were not different between groups. Baseline duodenal transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) 1 and 3 expression was increased in IBS-D, and TRPV3 in IBS-C. Duodenal TRPV1 expression correlated with abdominal pain (r = 0.51, FDR = 0.01), and inversely with first rectal sensation (r = −0.48, FDR = 0.01) and pain (r = −0.41, FDR = 0.02) thresholds. Conclusion: Lipid infusion elicits a greater symptom response in IBS patients than HV, which is associated with small intestinal expression of TRPV channels. TRPV-mediated small intestinal chemosensitivity may mediate post-meal symptoms in IBS. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - INTRODUCTION:To determine the effect of peripheral CRF on intestinal barrier function in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pathophysiology has been linked to life stress, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and mast cell activation. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a major mediator of stress responses in the gastrointestinal tract, yet its role on IBS mucosal function remains largely unknown.METHODS:Intestinal response to sequential i.v. 5-mL saline solution (placebo) and CRF (100 g) was evaluated in 21 IBS-D and 17 healthy subjects (HSs). A 20-cm jejunal segment was perfused with an isosmotic solution and effluents collected at baseline, 30 minutes after placebo, and 60 minutes after CRF. We measured water flux, albumin output, tryptase release, stress hormones, cardiovascular and psychological responses, and abdominal pain. A jejunal biopsy was obtained for CRF receptor expression assessment.RESULTS:Water flux did not change after placebo in IBS-D and HS but significantly increased after CRF in IBS-D (P = 0.007). Basal luminal output of albumin was higher in IBS-D and increased further after CRF in IBS-D (P = 0.042). Basal jejunal tryptase release was higher in IBS-D, and CRF significantly increased it in both groups (P = 0.004), the response being higher in IBS-D than in HS (P = 0.0023). Abdominal pain worsened only in IBS-D after CRF and correlated with jejunal tryptase release, water flux, and albumin output. IBS-D displayed jejunal up-regulation of CRF2 and down-regulation of CRF1 compared with HS.DISCUSSION:Stress via CRF-driven mast cell activation seems to be relevant in the pathophysiology of IBS-D. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) have intestinal hyperpermeability, which contributes to their diarrhea and abdominal pain. MicroRNA 29 (MIR29) regulates intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D. We investigated and searched for targets of MIR29 and investigated the effects of disrupting Mir29 in mice. METHODS: We investigated expression MIR29A and B in intestinal biopsies collected during endoscopy from patients with IBS (n = 183) and without IBS (controls) (n = 36). Levels were correlated with disease phenotype. We also generated and studied Mir29-/- mice, in which expression of Mir29a and b, but not c, is lost. Colitis was induced by administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; intestinal tissues were collected and permeability was assessed. Microarray analysis was performed using tissues from Mir29-/- mice. Changes in levels of target genes were measured in human colonic epithelial cells and small intestinal epithelial cells after knockdown of MIR29 with anti-MIRs. RESULTS: Intestinal tissues from patients with IBS-D (but not IBS with constipation or controls) had increased levels of MIR29A and B, but reduced levels of Claudin-1 (CLDN1) and nuclear factor-κB-repressing factor (NKRF). Induction of colitis and water avoidance stress increased levels of Mir29a and Mir29b and intestinal permeability in wild-type mice; these increased intestinal permeability in colons of far fewer Mir29-/- mice. In microarray and knockdown experiments, MIR29A and B were found to reduce levels of NKRF and CLDN1 messenger RNA, and alter levels of other messenger RNAs that regulate intestinal permeability. CONCLUSIONS: Based on experiments in knockout mice and analyses of intestinal tissue samples from patients with IBS-D, MIR29 targets and reduces expression of CLDN1 and NKRF to increase intestinal permeability. Strategies to block MIR29 might be developed to restore intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D. © 2015 AGA Institute.

AB  - Background/Aims: Intestinal permeability and stress have been implicated in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Cytokeratin 8 (CK8), for the first time, has been shown to mediate corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-induced changes in intestinal permeability in animal models of IBS. In this study, we investigated the regulatory effects of CRF on the permeability of human intestinal epithelial cells through the CK8-mediated tight junction. Methods: The expression levels of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1) and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 (CRFR2) on the HT29 cell surface were determined by immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. After treatment with 100 nM CRF for 72 h, the translocation of FITC-labelled dextran was measured in a transwell chamber; the structural changes of tight junctions were observed under transmission electron microscopy; the expression levels of CK8, F-actin and tight junction proteins ZO-1, claudin-1, and occludin were detected by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. The activity of RhoA was detected by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the effects of CRF on intestinal epithelial permeability were examined in CK8-silenced HT29 cells, which were constructed by shRNA interference. Results: CRF treatment increased FITC-labelled dextran permeability, caused the opening of tight junctions, induced increased fluorescence intensity of CK8 and decreased the intensities of ZO-1, claudin-1, and occludin, together with structural disruption. The expression levels of F-actin, occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 were downregulated. RhoA activity peaked at 30 min after CRF treatment. CRF-induced increased permeability, and downregulation of claudin-1 and occludin were not blocked by CK8 silencing. Nevertheless, CK8 silencing blocked the effects of CRF regarding the decrease in the expression levels of F-action and ZO-1 and increase in RhoA activity. Conclusion: CRF may increase intestinal epithelial permeability by upregulating CK8 expression, activating the RhoA signalling pathway, promoting intestinal epithelial actin remodelling, and decreasing the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1. Other CK8-independent pathways may be involved in the downregulation of claudin-1 and occludin, which might also contribute to increased intestinal epithelial permeability. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Intestinal permeability and the effect of NSAIDs on permeability were investigated in 14 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and 15 healthy subjects. In the study, 24-h urinary recoveries of orally administered polyethylene glycols (PEGs 400, 1500, and 4000) were not significantly different in healthy subjects and IBS patients before or after NSAID ingestion. Lactulose mannitol ratios in healthy subjects and IBS patients were not significantly different. Only time-dependent monitoring of PEG excretion showed that NSAIDs enhanced intestinal permeability for PEG 4000 in healthy subjects (P = 0.050) and for PEGs 400, 1500, and 4000 in IBS patients (P = 0.012, P = 0.041, and P = 0.012, respectively). These results show that intestinal permeability in IBS patients is not different from that in healthy subjects; NSAIDs compromise intestinal permeability in IBS patients to a greater extent than in healthy subjects, which suggests that IBS is associated with an altered response of the intestinal barrier to noxious agents. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Background Alterations in serotonergic (5-HT) metabolism and/or intestinal integrity have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Aims To assess the effects of the precursor of 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on mucosal 5-HT availability and intestinal integrity, and to assess potential differences between healthy controls and IBS patients. Methods Fifteen IBS patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study. Intestinal integrity was assessed by dual-sugar test and by determining the mucosal expression of tight junction proteins after ingestion of an oral bolus of 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo. Mucosal serotonergic metabolism was assessed in duodenal biopsy samples. Results 5-HTP administration significantly increased mucosal levels of 5-HIAA, the main metabolite of 5-HT, in both healthy controls (7.1 ± 1.7 vs. 2.5 ± 0.7 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P = 0.02) and IBS patients (20.0 ± 4.8 vs. 8.1 ± 1.3 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P = 0.02), with the latter group showing a significantly larger increase. Lactulose/L-rhamnose ratios were significantly lower after administration of 5-HTP (P < 0.05) in healthy controls and were accompanied by redistribution of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), pointing to reinforcement of the barrier. In IBS, expression of the tight junction proteins was significantly lower compared to healthy controls, and 5-HTP resulted in a further decrease in occludin expression. Conclusions Oral 5-HTP induced alterations in mucosal 5-HT metabolism. In healthy controls, a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier was seen whereas such reaction was absent in IBS patients. This could indicate the presence of a serotonin-mediated mechanism aimed to reinforce intestinal barrier function, which seems to dysfunction in IBS patients. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a key etiologic factor of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Metformin improves intestinal barrier function, although the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully explained. This study evaluates the protective effect of metformin on colonic barrier integrity and explores the underlying cellular mechanisms. Methods: IBS-like rats were induced by maternal separation. Metformin was administered daily by gavage at 08:30, and rat pups were then separated from their mother. Visceral hyperalgesia and depression-like behaviors were evaluated by colorectal distension, sucrose preference tests, and forced swimming tests. Intestinal integrity was analyzed using sugar probes and transmission electron microscopy. Inflammatory factors and the levels of corticotropin-releasing factor were assessed by PCR and ELISA. The number of mast cells was evaluated by toluidine blue staining. Protein expression and localization were determined using Western blot and immunochemistry. Key Results: Metformin pretreatment (a) reduced visceral hypersensitivity to colorectal distension, immobility time and enhanced sucrose consumption; (b) decreased urine lactulose/mannitol ratio and sucralose output; (c) inhibited the dilation of tight junction and prevented claudin-4 translocation; (d) inhibited mast cell activation and downregulated the expression of IL-6, IL-18, tryptase, PAR-2, and ERK activation; (e) inhibited claudin-4 phosphorylation at serine sites and interactions between clau-4 and ZO-1. Conclusions & Inferences: Metformin may block mast cell activation to reduce PAR-2 expression and subsequently inhibit ERK activation and clau-4 phosphorylation at serine sites to normalize the interaction of clau-4 and ZO-1 and clau-4 distribution. Metformin may be clinically beneficial for patients with IBS or IBS-like symptoms. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - OBJECTIVES:The objective of this study was to determine whether constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is associated with changes in intestinal barrier and secretory function.METHODS:A total of 19 IBS-C patients and 18 healthy volunteers (all females) underwent saccharide excretion assay (0.1 g 13 C mannitol and 1 g lactulose), measurements of duodenal and colonic mucosal barrier (transmucosal resistance (TMR), macromolecular and Escherichia coli Bio-Particle translocation), mucosal secretion (basal and acetylcholine (Ach)-evoked short-circuit current (Isc)), in vivo duodenal mucosal impedance, circulating endotoxins, and colonic tight junction gene expression.RESULTS:There were no differences in the in vivo measurements of barrier function between IBS-C patients and healthy controls: cumulative excretion of 13 C mannitol (0-2 h mean (s.e.m.); IBS-C: 12.1 (0.9) mg vs. healthy: 13.2 (0.8) mg) and lactulose (8-24 h; IBS-C: 0.9 (0.5) mg vs. healthy: 0.5 (0.2) mg); duodenal impedance IBS-C: 729 (65) Ω vs. healthy: 706 (43) Ω; plasma mean endotoxin activity level IBS-C: 0.36 (0.03) vs. healthy: 0.35 (0.02); and in colonic mRNA expression of occludin, zonula occludens (ZO) 1-3, and claudins 1-12 and 14-19. The ex vivo findings were consistent, with no group differences: duodenal TMR (IBS-C: 28.2 (1.9) Ω cm 2 vs. healthy: 29.8 (1.9) Ω cm 2) and colonic TMR (IBS-C: 19.1 (1.1) Ω cm 2 vs. healthy: 17.6 (1.7) Ω cm 2); fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (4 kDa) and E. coli Bio-Particle flux. Colonic basal Isc was similar, but duodenal basal Isc was lower in IBS-C (43.5 (4.5) μA cm -2) vs. healthy (56.9 (4.9) μA cm -2), P=0.05. Ach-evoked Î "Isc was similar.CONCLUSIONS:Females with IBS-C have normal colonic barrier and secretory function. Basal duodenal secretion is decreased in IBS-C. © 2017 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Proteasome-mediated protein degradation may contribute to the regulation of intestinal inflammation. At the same time, low-grade inflammation and increased intestinal permeability seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thus, we aimed to evaluate proteasome composition and activities in colonic mucosa of IBS patients and its putative pathogenic role.METHODS: Proteasome activities and proteasome subunit expression were measured in colonic mucosa of IBS, Crohn's disease (CD), and control patients by fluorometric assays and western blot, respectively. Expression of inhibitor of kappa B factor (IBα) and occludin, a tight junction protein, was also evaluated in colonic biopsies. The degradation of recombinant occludin incubated with protein extracts from colonic mucosa was evaluated in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor, MG132.RESULTS: Proteasome trypsin-like activity was increased in IBS patients compared with CD and controls, whereas chymotrypsin-like activity was upregulated in CD patients only. Caspase-like activity was reduced both in IBS and CD patients. IBα expression was similar between IBS and controls. In contrast, occludin expression was lower in IBS than in controls, but occludin mRNA level was similar. Protein extracts from IBS patients but not from controls degraded recombinant occludin (20% over 160 min), which was blocked by MG132. Although mast cell number was increased in IBS patients, no correlation was found between this number and proteasome alterations.CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that proteasome alterations are present in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients and may contribute to the pathophysiology of IBS by increasing occludin degradation. © 2010 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Background: Neural-immune-endocrine network mechanism has attracted increased attention in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Pre-clinical evidence indicates that nerve growth factor (NGF) mediates visceral hypersensitivity and gut barrier dysfunction, via interactions with mast cells and sensory nerve fibres. Aim: To explore the role of nerve growth factor, as well as mast cell–nerve growth factor–nerve interaction in IBS-D pathophysiology. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, IBS-D patients and healthy controls first underwent clinical and psychological assessments. Visceral sensitivity to rectal distension was tested. As gut barrier function markers, serum diamine oxidase and d-lactate were detected. Rectosigmoid biopsies were taken for the analyses of nerve growth factor expression, mast cell count and activation, and sensory nerve fibres expressing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Correlations between these parameters were examined in patients. Results: Thirty-eight IBS-D patients (28 males, 10 females; average age 30.2 years) and 20 healthy controls (12 males, 8 females; average age 26.8 years) participated in the study. The patients presented increased psychological symptoms, visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier function. NGF gene expression, mast cell count and sensory nerve fibres were significantly increased in the patients (P < 0.05). In correlation analysis, NGF expression was positively correlated with the disease severity, anxiety and serum diamine oxidase; visceral sensitivity thresholds were negatively associated with NGF expression (Bonferroni corrected P < 0.0029). Conclusions: Elevated mucosal NGF may interact with mast cells and sensory nerve fibres, contributing to visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier function in IBS-D. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: This study aimed to determine whether patients with IBS displayed altered mucosal mast cell (MC) numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves compared with healthy subjects (HS) and whether these MC characteristics correlated with IBS symptoms, elements of the epithelial barrier, or visceral sensitivity. Methods: Mucosal MC characteristics were determined using immunoassay. IBS symptoms, gene expression of elements of the epithelial barrier, fecal serine protease activity, and visceral sensitivity were assessed. Key Results: The MC numbers per mm2 were 2.0 (0.0-6.0) in patients with IBS (n = 43) and 3.5 (1.1-9.1) in HS (n = 20, P =.26). Of these, MCs were 0.0 (0.0-20) % vs 3.1 (0.0-18) % (P =.76) in IBS and HS, respectively, in co-localization with nerve fibers. MC characteristics were equivalent in the different IBS subtypes. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified two distinct groups among patients with IBS: MC high (higher MC numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves) and MC low (lower MC numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves). The MC high and MC low groups could not be discriminated with regard to IBS symptoms, parameters of visceral sensitivity, gene expression of elements of the epithelial barrier, and fecal protease activity. Conclusion and Inferences: There was no evidence of increased infiltration or altered localization of MCs in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS. These MC characteristics were not linked to global IBS symptoms or mucosal expression of elements of the epithelial barrier. These findings indicate that quantity and location of mucosal MCs are factors not involved in the pathophysiology of IBS. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The intestinal barrier dysfunction is a critical pathological change in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Prim-O-glucosylcimifugin (POG) on intestinal barrier dysfunction and reveal possible molecular mechanisms. Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) cell monolayers induced by tryptase (TRYP) were used to establish an intestinal barrier dysfunction model. Caco-2 cell monolayers from both functional and dysfunctional samples were treated with POG (30, 60 and 120µg/mL) for 2, 8, 24, 36, 48 and 72h. The Caco-2 cell monolayers were assessed by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and percentage of fluorescein permeation (PFP). The expression of Protease Activated Receptor 2 (PAR-2) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR and the level of Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) protein expression was determined by Western blot. In addition, the impact of POG on the distribution of the tight juction protein of Occludin was performed by immunofluorescence. Our results showed that POG elevated the TEER and decreased the PFP of the functional Caco-2 cell monolayers, as well as the dysfunctional Caco-2 cell monolayers. Furthermore, POG inhibited the expression of PAR-2 mRNA and MLCK mRNA and increased the level of ZO-1 protein expression in dysfunctional Caco-2 cells. The distribution of the Occludin proteins was ameliorated simultaneously. This study demonstrates that POG can enhance the intestinal barrier function of Caco-2 cell monolayers by inhibiting the expression of PAR-2 and MLCK and up-regulating the expression of ZO-1 protein, and ameliorated the distribution of Occludin protein. © 2018 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan

AB  - Background & Aims Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis and symptoms of IBS develop following gastroenteritis. We aimed to study the passage of live bacteria through the colonic epithelium, and determine the role of mast cells (MCs) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in barrier regulation in IBS and healthy individuals. Methods Colon biopsies from 32 women with IBS and 15 age-matched healthy women (controls) were mounted in Ussing chambers; we measured numbers of fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli HS and Salmonella typhimurium that passed through from the mucosal side to the serosal side of the tissue. Some biopsies were exposed to agents that block the VIP receptors (VPAC1 and VPAC2) or MCs. Levels of VIP and tryptase were measured in plasma and biopsy lysates. Number of MCs and MCs that express VIP or VIP receptors were quantified by immunofluorescence. Biopsies from an additional 5 patients with IBS and 4 controls were mounted in chambers and Salmonella were added; we studied passage routes through the epithelium by transmission electron microscopy and expression of tight junctions by confocal microscopy. Results In colon biopsies from patients with IBS, larger numbers of E coli HS and S typhimurium passed through the epithelium than in biopsies from controls (P <.0005). In transmission electron microscopy analyses, bacteria were found to cross the epithelium via only the transcellular route. Bacterial passage was reduced in biopsies from patients with IBS and controls after addition of antibodies against VPACs or ketotifen, which inhibits MCs. Plasma samples from patients with IBS had higher levels of VIP than plasma samples from controls. Biopsies from patients with IBS had higher levels of tryptase, larger numbers of MCs, and a higher percentage of MCs that express VPAC1 than biopsies from controls. In biopsies from patients with IBS, addition of Salmonella significantly reduced levels of occludin; subsequent addition of ketotifen significantly reversed this effect. Conclusions We found that colonic epithelium tissues from patients with IBS have increased translocation of commensal and pathogenic live bacteria compared with controls. The mechanisms of increased translocation include MCs and VIP. © 2017 AGA Institute

AB  - Background: The precise pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains unresolved; however, recent studies have reported that patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS exhibit an increased small intestinal permeability and increased number of enterochromaffin cells containing high 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT; serotonin) levels. In this study, we investigated whether 5HT has the potential to modulate small intestinal epithelial cell permeability, focusing on tight junction-associated proteins. Methods: The differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayer on porous filters (Millicell) was used. Then, 5HT was added to the lower Millicell compartment for 7 days. Intestinal epithelial cell permeability was assessed by measuring the flux of paracellular permeability markers. We further assessed the expression of occludin in the 5HT-stimulated Caco-2 monolayer. Results: We found that 5HT did not affect the viability of Caco-2 cells at concentrations up to 100 µM during the experimental period. Administration of 5HT to the basal side of Caco-2 cells increased the flux of 3H-labeled mannitol (182 Da) but did not increase that of FITC-dextran (4000 Da). Among the tight junction proteins, the expression of occludin was specifically decreased by stimulation with 5HT at a concentration of 100 µM. Conclusion: In conclusion, excessive 5HT in the basal side increased the permeability of intestinal epithelial cells via reduction of occludin expression. © Copyright 2022 by The Turkish Society of Gastroenterology

AB  - Introduction: Impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function is a hallmark of a variety of pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBD patients with IBS-like symptoms show higher interleukin-13 (IL-13) serum levels and poor psychological well-being. Supplementary glutamine reduced the daily bowel movement frequency, improved the stool form, and normalized intestinal hyperpermeability. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of IL-13 and supplementary glutamine on human intestinal epithelial function in vitro. Methods: Caco-2 cells were grown on TranswellTM inserts. -IL-13 was added to the basolateral compartment, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability measured. Effects of glutamine or the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were assessed. Involvement of tight junction proteins was assessed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Results: IL-13 significantly decreased TEER and increased FITC labeled-dextran epithelial permeability. IL-13 stimulation decreased the claudin-1 expression and increased the claudin-2 expression. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced decrease of TEER and increase of FITC labeled-dextran permeability. Further, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor showed this alleviating effect while the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 inhibitor did not. Conclusions: IL-13 induced barrier integrity impairment by decreasing claudin-1 and increasing claudin-2. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced barrier dysfunction by increasing claudin-1 expression, via disruption of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway.  © 2021 S. Karger AG.

AB  - Aims: Defective tight junctions (TJs) can induce intestinal epithelial dysfunction, which participates in various diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. However, the mechanisms of TJ defects remain unclear. Our study revealed the role of Piezo1 in regulating intestinal epithelial function and TJs. Materials and methods: The human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 were cultured on Transwell plate to form an epithelial barrier in vitro, and Piezo1 expression was manipulated using a lentivirus vector. Epithelial function was evaluated by measuring transepithelial electronic resistance (TEER) and 4-kDa FITC-dextran (FD4) transmission. TJ proteins (claudin-1, occludin, ZO-1) were evaluated by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunostaining analysis. Potential signal pathways, including the ROCK and Erk pathways, were detected. Moreover, to explore the regulatory effect of Piezo1 activity on epithelial function, inhibitors (ruthenium red, GsMTx4) and an agonist (Yoda1) were introduced both ex vivo and in vitro. Key findings: Alteration of Piezo1 expression altered epithelial function and the expression of the tight junction protein claudin-1. Piezo1 expression regulated phosphorylated ROCK1/2 expression, whereas interference on ROCK1/2 prevented the regulation of claudin-1 by Piezo1. In both Caco-2 monolayer and mouse colon epithelium, Piezo1 activity directly modulated epithelial function and permeability. Significance: Piezo1 negatively regulates epithelial barrier function by affecting the expression of claudin-1. Such regulation may be achieved partially via the ROCK1/2 pathway. Moreover, activating Piezo1 can induce epithelial dysfunction. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background. Alterations of the small-intestinal permeability (s-IP) might play an essential role in a subgroup of diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) patients. Goals. (a) To analyse in D-IBS patients the symptom profile in relation to the altered (+) or not (−) s-IP using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). (b) To assess the circulating levels of the adipokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, leptin, and adiponectin, along with LPS, TLR-4, neurotensin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The frequency distribution of SNPs at the loci for the investigated molecules and leptin receptor was evaluated. Study. The study included 34 D-IBS patients and 17 healthy controls (HC). s-IP permeability was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography determination in the urine of the lactulose to mannitol ratio. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, LPS, TLR-4, leptin, adiponectin, neurotensin, and BDNF were assayed by ELISA. Screening of genetic variants was done employing the restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction method. Results. D-IBS(−) patients had a significantly higher GSRS cluster pain and diarrhoea profile than D-IBS(+) ones. Significant correlations were found between the symptoms clusters and immune activation and inflammation markers. The levels of adipo(cyto)kines in D-IBS(+) patients were higher than those of controls, and IL-6 levels correlated with those of LPS. Leptin and BDNF were significantly higher, and neurotensin levels were significantly lower in D-IBS(+) than in controls. No differences were found in the frequency distribution of genotypes among the study groups. Conclusions. Results from this study could be of some help in the characterization of the DIBS and highlight the contribution of an altered intestinal barrier in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. Besides, a role could be ascribed to molecules secreted by the visceral adipose tissue that can impact on barrier functions. Copyright © 2018 Francesco Russo et al.

AB  - Background: To determine the effect of Shuganyin decoction (SGD) on the intestinal barrier function in an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rat model induced by water-avoidance stress. Methods: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into control, water-avoidance stress (WAS) group, WAS plus Shuganyin decoction (SGD) group and WAS plus dicetel (Dicetel) group. IBS was induced in rats by subjecting them to water-avoidance stress for 7 days. On day 4 of the WAS protocol, the rats were treated for 7 consecutive days (days 4-11) with SGD, dicetel or a negative control (saline). The number of feces granules, histopathological changes of the intestine and mast cell (MC) morphometry were determined. Intestinal permeability was approximated by measuring the absorption of FITC-dextran 4400 (FD-4) from the lumen into the bloodstream in vivo and in vitro experiments. Also, the expression of protease active receptor-2 (PAR-2) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was estimated using immunohistochemical staining and ELISA, respectively. Tight junction (TJ) protein abundance was measured following a quantitative immunofluorescent analysis of intestinal sections and western blotting. Results: In vivo, WAS elicited a significantly increase in the transfer of FD-4 from the intestine to blood about threefold in 30 min compared with control group. After treated with SGD, the intestinal permeability to FD-4 of WAS-induced rats was significantly attenuated (P < 0.05). In vitro, the permeability coefficient (Papp) values were measured for FD-4 absorption across the excised intestine. WAS was shown to increase the intestinal permeability to (4.695 ± 0.3629) × 10-7 cm/s in 120 min, which was 2.6-fold higher than the control group. Rats treated with SGD showed a significant decrease in Papp values of FD-4 as compared to WAS group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, by immunofluorescent detection we found that WAS elicited the irregular distribution of TJ proteins. Using the quantitative analysis software of the medical image, the average optical density and protein abundance of TJ proteins was shown to be lower in the WAS group as compared to control group, (P < 0.05). SGD could attenuate this response and improve TJ distribution (P < 0.05). Western blot analysis confirmed that TJ protein abundance was significantly decreased in WAS group and that they could be returned to control levels following an SGD treatment. WAS also induced an increase in number of MCs, their area and diameter as compared to controls. These observations were attenuated with an SGD or dicetel treatment. Similarly, the expression of PAR-2 and TNF-α exceeded control values in the WAS group and were shown to be successfully attenuated with an SGD treatment. Conclusion: WAS-induced IBS rat model exhibited intestinal barrier dysfunction, which was manifested as tight junction damage and structural rearrangements that increased the intestinal permeability. Under these conditions, MCs were activated and degranulated in the intestinal mucosa leading to the activation of PAR-2. Our data showed that SGD could inhibit the activation of MCs and down-regulate the expression of both PAR-2 and TNF-α. In turn, this was shown to improve the expression and structural arrangement of TJ proteins in the intestinal mucosa, thereby regulating the intestinal permeability. It was concluded that Shuganyin could protect the intestinal barrier. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background and Aims: Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed antibiotic, which has shown efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. However, the mechanism on how it effects in IBS is still incompletely defined. In this study, Trichinella spiralis-infected post-infectious (PI) IBS mouse model was used, to assess the action of rifaximin on visceral hypersensitivity, barrier function, gut inflammation, and microbiota. Methods: Post-infectious IBS model was established by T. spiralis infection in mice. Rifaximin were administered to PI-IBS mice for seven consecutive days. The abdominal withdrawal reflex and threshold of colorectal distention were employed to evaluate visceral sensitivity. Smooth muscle contractile response was recorded in the organ bath. Intestinal permeability was measured by Ussing chamber. Expression of tight junction protein and cytokines were measured by Western blotting. Ilumina miseq platform was used to analyze bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA. Results: Post-infectious IBS mice treated with rifaximin exhibited decreased abdominal withdrawal reflex score, increased threshold, reduced contractile response, and intestinal permeability. Rifaximin also suppressed the expression of interleukin-12 and interleukin-17 and promoted the expression of the major tight junction protein occludin. Furthermore, rifaximin did not change the composition and diversity, and the study reavealed that rifaximin had a tiny effect on the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in this PI-IBS model. Conclusions: Rifaximin alleviated visceral hypersensitivity, recovered intestinal barrier function, and inhibited low-grade inflammation in colon and ileum of PI-IBS mouse model. Moreover, rifaximin exerts anti-inflammatory effects with only a minimal effect on the overall composition and diversity of the gut microbiota in this model. © 2017 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Background: Intestinal permeability is altered in a subgroup of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and may contribute to symptom development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effect of the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) on Caco-2 permeability alterations induced by mediators released by IBS mucosal biopsies compared to asymptomatic controls (AC). Methods: Caco-2 cells were used as an in vitro model of intestinal permeability. Seven AC and 28 well-phenotyped IBS (9 IBS-D, 8 IBS-C, and 11 IBS-M) patients were enrolled. Mucosal mediators spontaneously released (SUP) by IBS and AC biopsies were collected. Two concentrations of EcN (108 and 106) were applied to Caco-2 with or without SUP or SLIGRL (a protease-activated receptor-2 activating peptide), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ. Paracellular permeability was assessed by evaluating the flow of sulfonic-acid conjugated to fluorescein through Caco-2 monolayer. Key Results: EcN 108 significantly reinforced Caco-2 monolayer compared to cells incubated with medium alone. IBS SUP induced a significant increase in paracellular permeability compared to AC SUP, independently of IBS bowel habit. EcN 108 induced a significant recovery of permeability rate compared to IBS SUP. Permeability increase induced by IBS SUP significantly correlated with severity and frequency of abdominal pain and abdominal distension. The co-incubation of EcN and IBS SUP abolished the above significant correlations. Conclusions and Inferences: EcN reinforces the integrity of Caco-2 monolayer and reverts the increase of permeability induced by mediators released by IBS biopsies. Future studies should investigate EcN therapeutic potentials in IBS. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome is a common clinical phenomenon of uncertain aetiology. Aim: To test the association between intestinal permeability and irritable bowel syndrome symptoms 2 years after a large waterborne outbreak of bacterial gastroenteritis. Methods: Consecutive adults with Rome I irritable bowel syndrome and controls without irritable bowel syndrome attending a community clinic were enrolled. Intestinal permeability was measured as the ratio of fractional urinary excretions of lactulose and mannitol, and compared among cases vs. controls and predictors of abnormal intestinal permeability were assessed. Results: A total of 218 subjects (132 irritable bowel syndrome cases and 86 non-irritable bowel syndrome controls) completed the study protocol. About 27 (12%) had been diagnosed with the irritable bowel syndrome before the outbreak and 115 (53%) had been ill during the outbreak. Lactulose-mannitol ratios were increased among cases vs. controls (Mann-Whitney mean rank 118.8 vs. 95.3, P = 0.007), and cases were more likely to have a ratio >0.020 (P = 0.007). Among cases, those with increased intestinal permeability were more likely to report increased stool frequency. Both irritable bowel syndrome symptoms and male gender, but not diarrhoeal illness during the outbreak, were significant predictors of abnormal permeability. Conclusions: Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are associated with a subtle increase in intestinal permeability irrespective of prior gastroenteritis. This may improve understanding of the aetiology of both sporadic and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder linked to intestinal barrier dysfunction and life stress. We have previously reported that female sex per se determines an increased susceptibility to intestinal barrier dysfunction after cold pain stress (CPS). We aimed to identify sex-related molecular differences in response to CPS in healthy subjects to understand the origin of sex bias predominance in IBS. In 13 healthy males and 21 females, two consecutive jejunal biopsies were obtained using Watson’s capsule, at baseline, and ninety minutes after CPS. Total mucosal RNA and protein were isolated from jejunal biopsies. Expression of genes related to epithelial barrier (CLDN1, CLDN2, OCLN, ZO-1, and ZO-3), mast cell (MC) activation (TPSAB1, SERPINA1), and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) were analyzed using RT-qPCR. NR3C1, ZO-1 and OCLN protein expression were evaluated through immunohistochemistry and western blot, and mucosal inflammation through MC, lymphocyte, and eosinophil numbering. Autonomic, hormonal, and psychological responses to CPS were monitored. We found an increase in jejunal MCs, a reduced CLDN1 and OCLN expression, and an increased CLDN2 and SERPINA1 expression 90 min after CPS. We also found a significant decrease in ZO-1, OCLN, and NR3C1 gene expression, and a decrease in OCLN protein expression only in females, when compared to males. CPS induced a significant increase in blood pressure, plasma cortisol and ACTH, and subjective stress perception in all participants. Specific and independent sex-related molecular responses in epithelial barrier regulation are unraveled by acute stress in the jejunum of healthy subjects and may partially explain female predominance in IBS. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects and related mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly allocated into normal, model, and EA groups. Experimental IBS mice models were established by exposure to water avoidance stress (WAS). Mice in the EA group were treated with EA at bilateral Tianshu (ST 25) and Zusanli (ST 36) for 7 consecutive days, 15 min each day. Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) tests and intestinal motility tests were performed to evaluate visceral sensitivity and intestinal motility of mice. Expression levels of tight junction proteins (TJPs) and inflammatory cytokines in colon tissues were determined through immunofluorescence, real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and Western blot assays. RESULTS: EA alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal hypermotility in WAS-induced IBS mice. Moreover, EA promoted the expression of zonula occludens (ZO)-1, claudin-1, and occludin while suppressing the expression of interleukin (IL)-8, interferon (IFN)-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-αin water avoidance stress (WAS)-induced irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) mice. CONCLUSION: EA alleviated WAS-induced IBS in mice by promoting intestinal barrier functions and suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines. © 2023 JTCM. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: A Giardia outbreak in Bergen, Norway, caused postinfectious functional gastrointestinal disorders (PI-FGIDs). Despite the devastating effects of this outbreak, it presented a unique chance to investigate the implication on the dysregulation of genetic pathways in PI-FGID. Methods: We performed the first comparative expression profiling of miRNAs and their potential target genes in microdissected rectal biopsies from 20 Giardia-induced PI-FGID patients vs 18 healthy controls by nCounter analysis. Subsequently, candidates were validated on protein level by immunostaining. Key Results: miRNA profiling on rectal biopsy samples from 5 diarrhea-predominant PI-IBS cases compared to 10 healthy controls revealed differential expression in the epithelial layer. The top five regulated miRNAs were implicated in GI disease, inflammatory response, and immunological disease. Subsequently, these miRNAs and 100 potential mRNA targets were examined in 20 PI-FGID cases and 18 healthy controls in both the mucosal epithelium and the lamina propria. Although deregulation of the selected miRNAs could not be verified in the larger sample set, mRNAs involved in barrier function were downregulated in the epithelium. Pro-inflammatory genes and genes implicated in epigenetic modifications were upregulated in the lamina propria. Immunostaining for selected candidates on 17 PI-FGID cases and 16 healthy controls revealed increased tryptase levels as well as a decreased and aberrant subcellular expression of occludin. Conclusions and Inferences: Genes relevant to immune and barrier function as well as stress response and epigenetic modulation are differentially expressed in PI-FGIDs and may contribute to disease manifestation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: Altered intestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation have been reported in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Increased cell extrusion in the epithelium as measured by epithelial gaps may be associated with barrier dysfunction and may lead to mucosal inflammation. Confocal laser endomicroscopy can be used to identify and quantitate epithelial gaps in the small intestine. Objective: To determine the epithelial gap density in IBS and healthy control patients. Design: Prospective, controlled cohort study. Setting: A tertiary referral center. Patients: In IBS and control patients undergoing routine colonoscopy, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy was used to image the terminal ileum. Main Outcome Measurements: The primary outcome was the density of epithelial gaps (gaps/cells counted) in adequately imaged villi using pCLE. Images were reviewed by 2 blinded reviewers. Results: We recruited 18 healthy controls and 16 IBS patients. The median epithelial gap densities for control and IBS patients were 6 and 32 gaps per 1000 cells, respectively (P <.001). There was a trend toward higher gap density in female (P =.07) and younger (ρ = -0.43, P =.07) patients. Using 3% (90% of the control population) as the cutoff for abnormal gap density, we found the diagnostic accuracy for IBS to be as follows: 62% sensitivity, 89% specificity, 83% positive predictive value, and 73% negative predictive value. Limitations: A single-center study, small number of patients. Conclusions: IBS patients have significantly more epithelial gaps in their small intestine compared with healthy controls, which suggests that increased epithelial cell extrusion may be a cause of altered intestinal permeability observed in IBS. © 2013 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

AB  - Background: Intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). In order to explore the mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment on intestinal mucosal barrier, this study observed the effect of EA on aquaporins (AQPs), tight junctions (TJs), NF-κB pathway and the gut microbiota in IBS-D rats. Methods: The IBS-D model was established by acetic acid enema combined with chronic restraint method. The effects of EA on the treatment of IBS-D were examined by the abdominal withdrawal reflex score, Bristol's fecal character score, fecal water content, small intestine propulsion rate and HE staining. AQPs, TJs and inflammation-related molecular mechanisms were explored. The fecal samples were applied for 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the effect of EA intervention to the intestinal bacterial abundance. Results: EA reduced intestinal sensitization, restored intestinal motility and improved inflammatory cell infiltration. Furthermore, EA improved intestinal inflammation and flora environment significantly, inhibited NF-κB signaling and inflammatory factors (IL-1β and TNF-α). It can also increase the gene and protein expression of AQPs (AQP1, AQP3, and AQP8) and the gene levels of TJs (ZO-1 and Occludin). Conclusion: EA has an inhibitory effect on the NF-κB signaling pathway, and regulates the proteins of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8, and TJs to restore the balance of water metabolism and intestinal permeability in IBS-D, which also restored the function of the intestinal mucosa by regulating the intestinal flora. Graphical Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) is a common gastrointestinal disease in clinical practice, which was affected by intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction, intestinal mucosal inflammation production and abnormal intestinal flora, then there is currently no specific drug for treating IBS-D. Electroacupuncture (EA), as a non-pharmacological therapy, has good therapeutic effects in treating IBS-D. Aquaporins (AQPs) are distributed in the intestinal mucosa of the intestine and are important factors in mediating water–liquid transmembrane transport. Changes in AQPs expression have been identified as a common factor in the etiology of certain gastrointestinal diseases. AQP1, AQP3, and AQP8 are distributed in the distal colon. EA can inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway, and regulate the proteins of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8, and TJs to restore the balance of water metabolism and intestinal permeability in IBS-D, which also can restore the function of the intestinal mucosa by regulating the intestinal flora.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterised by gastrointestinal (GI) and psychological symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, and somatization). Depression and anxiety, but not somatization, have already been associated with altered intestinal barrier function, increased LPS, and dysbiosis. The study aimed to investigate the possible link between somatization and intestinal barrier in IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) patients. Methods: Forty-seven IBS-D patients were classified as having low somatization (LS = 19) or high somatization (HS = 28) according to the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), (cut-off score = 63). The IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaires were administered to evaluate GI symptoms. The intestinal barrier function was studied by the lactulose/mannitol absorption test, faecal and serum zonulin, serum intestinal fatty-acid binding protein, and diamine oxidase. Inflammation was assessed by assaying serum Interleukins (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), and tumour necrosis factor-α. Dysbiosis was assessed by the urinary concentrations of indole and skatole and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS). All data were analysed using a non-parametric test. Results: The GI symptoms profiles were significantly more severe, both as a single symptom and as clusters of IBS-SSS and GSRS, in HS than LS patients. This finding was associated with impaired small intestinal permeability and increased faecal zonulin levels. Besides, HS patients showed significantly higher IL-8 and lowered IL-10 concentrations than LS patients. Lastly, circulating LPS levels and the urinary concentrations of indole were higher in HS than LS ones, suggesting a more pronounced imbalance of the small intestine in the former patients. Conclusions: IBS is a multifactorial disorder needing complete clinical, psychological, and biochemical evaluations.

AB  - Background: Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang (TXYF) has been shown to be effective in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) patients. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and related mechanisms of TXYF in an IBS-D rat model. Methods: The IBS-D rat model was established with 4% acetic acid and evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Then, IBS-D rats were divided into control, TXYF and rifaximin groups and treated intragastrically with normal saline, TXYF and rifaximin, respectively, for 14 days. The following indicators were measured before and after treatment: defecation frequency, faecal water content (FWC) and colorectal distension (CRD). Histopathological changes in the distal colon were observed after treatment. The expression of OCLN and ZO1 in the distal colon of IBS-D rats reflected the intestinal mucosal permeability, as measured by qRT-PCR, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The NF-κB and Notch signalling pathways and inflammation-related factors were investigated. Results: After treatment with TXYF, the defecation frequency, FWC and CRD were significantly lower than those in the model group (P < 0.05). HE staining showed that colonic epithelial cells (CECs) in the IBS-D rats displayed significant oedema, impaired intestinal mucosal integrity and an increased influx of inflammatory cells. A significant reduction in granulocyte and CEC oedema was observed after the administration of TXYF and rifaximin compared to that of the model group and blank group (P < 0.05). TXYF significantly upregulated the expression of OCLN and ZO-1 and downregulated inflammation-related factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α and the chemokine KC) in IBS-D rats compared to those in the model group rats (P < 0.05). In terms of the NF-κB and Notch signalling pathways, the expression of NICD, p-ERK, Hes-1 and p-P65 decreased significantly in the TXYF and rifaximin groups, while the expression of ATOH1 increased significantly compared to that in the model group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: TXYF can effectively improve intestinal permeability and enhance intestinal mucosal barrier function, which may be related to inhibition of the inflammatory cascade and the NF-κB and Notch signalling pathways. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - A role for immunoproteasome in the regulation of intestinal permeability has been previously suggested both in mice during water avoidance stress (WAS) and in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Here, we provide evidence that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) contributes to the pathophysiology of IBS. Indeed, we report that colonic proteome is altered in WAS mice and that β2i subunit deficiency modifies the proteome response that is associated with a limitation of colonic hyperpermeability. Interestingly, we show specific alterations of proteins involved in UPS, mitochondrial, and energy metabolism. We also report changes in the pattern of colonic ubiquitome in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients and particularly a reduced expression of ubiquitinated proteins involved in the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) inflammatory signaling pathway. All these data suggest that immunoproteasome targeting may represent a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBS patients with increased intestinal permeability. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often show psychological disorders, including somatization, usually driven by an altered gut–brain axis. These changes are also accompanied by modifications in the circulating levels of vitamin D (VD) and neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and circulating levels of VD, 5-HT, and BDNF in IBS patients with diarrhea (IBS-D) categorized according to somatization. Methods: Fifty-three IBS-D patients were recruited and profiled for GI symptoms by validated questionnaires. The fasting serum concentrations of VD, 5-HT, and BDNF were assessed. The health of the intestinal barrier, minimal inflammation, and dysbiosis was also evaluated. Key Results: Thirty patients showed high somatization scores, IBS-D(S+), and 23 low somatization scores, IBS-D(S-). IBS-D(S+) patients reported higher “Abdominal pain” and the “Abdominal pain duration in days” scores, lower serum VD levels and increased 5-HT and BDNF concentrations than IBS-D(S-). Besides, in IBS-D(S+) patients, the GI symptoms correlated with 5HT, BDNF, and VD concentrations. These parameters were associated with impaired small intestinal permeability and increased inflammation markers. Conclusions and Inferences: These data support the multifactorial IBS pathogenesis in which organic and psychological factors interact. An active role by VD, 5-HT, and BDNF in affecting the clinical and biochemical profiles in IBS-D(S+) patients may be conceivable. Therefore, the routine VD estimation and the assay of circulating levels of 5-HT and BDNF could be considered a new approach for managing these patients. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The intestinal barrier plays a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients and in preventing the entry of pathogenic microorganisms and toxic molecules. Several studies have shown a compromised intestinal barrier associated with low-grade inflammation in the small intestinal mucosa in celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly in IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). In light of these new data, IBS is no longer considered a functional disease but rather a heterogeneous syndrome that has yet to be carefully studied. Therefore, investigating the integrity and function of the intestinal barrier is now essential to improving knowledge of the pathophysiology of IBS-D and to improving the management of IBS-D patients. However, the study of the intestinal barrier must clarify some still unsolved methodological aspects and propose standardised assays before becoming a useful diagnostic tool. In this framework, this review will discuss data about the tests that noninvasively evaluate the integrity and functionality of the human intestinal barrier, paying particular attention to patients with IBS-D, in both clinical and research situations.  © 2020 Michele Linsalata et al.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by visceral hypersensitivity and altered bowel function. There are increasing evidences suggested that VSL#3 probiotics therapy has been recognized as an effective method to relieve IBS-induced symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of VSL#3 probiotics on visceral hypersensitivity (VH), nitric oxide (NO), fecal character, colonic epithelium permeability, and tight junction protein expression. IBS model was induced by intracolonic instillation of 4% acetic acid and restraint stress in rats. After subsidence of inflammation on the seventh experimental day, the rats were subjected to rectal distension, and then the abdominal withdrawal reflex and the number of fecal output were measured, respectively. Also, colonic permeability to Evans blue was measured in vivo, and tight junction protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting method. Rats had been pretreated with VSL#3 or aminoguanidine (NOS inhibitor) or VSL#3? aminoguanidine before measurements. The rats at placebo group showed hypersensitive response to rectal distension (P<0.05) and defecated more stools than control rats (P<0.05), whereas VSL#3 treatment significantly attenuated VH and effectively reduced defecation. Aminoguanidine reduced the protective effects of VSL#3 on VH. A pronounced increase in epithelial permeability and decreased expression of tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1) in placebo group were prevented by VSL#3, but not aminoguanidine. VSL#3 treatment reduce the hypersensitivity, defecation, colonic permeability and increase the expression of tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1). As the part of this effect was lowered by NOS inhibitor, NO might play a role in the protective effect of VSL#3 to some extent. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Background: Alterations of the small-intestinal permeability (s-IP) might play an essential role in both diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) and celiac disease (CD) patients. Our aims were to analyse in D-IBS patients the symptom profile along with the levels of urinary sucrose (Su), lactulose (La), mannitol (Ma), and circulating biomarkers (zonulin, intestinal fatty acid binding protein - I-FABP, and diamine oxidase - DAO) of the gastrointestinal (GI) barrier function. The pro-inflammatory interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6 and IL-8), the plasma values of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) were also investigated. Besides, these biomarkers were compared with those in CD and healthy controls (HC). Finally, comparisons were performed between D-IBS patients with [D-IBS(+)] and without [D-IBS(-)] increased s-IP according to normal or altered La/Ma ratio. Methods: The study included 39 D-IBS patients, 32 CD patients, and 20 HC. GI permeability was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography determination in the urine of Su and La/Ma ratio. ELISA kits assayed circulating concentrations of zonulin, I-FABP, DAO, IL-6, IL-8, LPS, and TLR-4. The Mann-Whitney or the Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's post-test was used to assess differences among the groups. Results: As for the La/Ma ratio, %Su, and I-FABP levels, D-IBS patients were significantly different from CD, but not HC. IL-6 levels were significantly higher in CD than HC, whereas IL-8 levels were significantly higher in both D-IBS and CD patients than HC. By opposite, LPS, and TLR-4 concentrations did not differ significantly among the groups. When D-IBS patients were categorised according to normal or altered s-IP, D-IBS(+) patients had %La, %Su, I-FABP, and DAO levels significantly higher than D-IBS(-) ones. The inflammatory parameters and markers of bacterial translocation (namely, IL-6 and LPS) were significantly higher in D-IBS(+) patients than D-IBS(-) ones. Conclusions: The present study suggests that two distinct D-IBS subtypes could be identified. The investigation of possible s-IP alterations (i.e., considering the La/Ma ratio) might be useful to assess better and categorise this heterogeneous D-IBS population.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether electroacupuncture (EA) maintains intestinal homeostasis in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) rats by repairing intestinal barrier function through enteric glial cell (EGC)-derived S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into a control group (n = 10) and an IBS-D group (n = 20). These rats received senna solution by gavage and chronic unpredictable mild stress for 14 days and were further divided into a model group (n = 10) and an EA group (n = 10). Rats in the EA group were electroacupunctured at ST25 (Tianshu), ST36 (Zusanli), and LR3 (Taichong) for 20 min every day for 14 days. The abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR), the percentage of time spent in open arms (OT%) in the elevated plus maze test, and the diarrhea index (DI) were measured. Histopathological examination was performed to evaluate the pathological features of the colon after sacrificing the rats. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the EGC in the muscle and submucosal layers. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect GSNO expression in the colon. Double immunofluorescence labeling was used to detect the colocalized GFAP and GSNO expressions in the muscle and submucosal layers. Plasma FITC-dextran was used to measure intestinal permeability, whereas western blot was used to detect ZO-1 and occludin expressions in the colon. Results: OT% and ZO-1 and occludin expressions were significantly lower than those of the control group, whereas AWR scores, DI, GSNO expression in the colon, colocalized GFAP and GSNO expressions in the submucosal layer, and intestinal permeability were significantly higher than those of the control group. Structural EGC abnormalities were observed in the model group. After EA treatment, OT% and ZO-1 and occludin expressions increased significantly, whereas AWR scores, DI, GSNO expression, colocalized GFAP and GSNO expressions in the submucosal layer, and intestinal permeability decreased significantly. The EGC structure was then restored to its normal state. Conclusion: EA treatment downregulates the submucosal EGC–derived GSNO expressions, repairs the intestinal barrier by upregulating the ZO-1 and occludin expression, and improves IBS-D symptoms, including visceral hypersensitivity, anxiety, and diarrhea, suggesting a potential role for EGC-derived GSNO in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis in IBS-D rats.

AB  - Background/Aims: Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a chronic, functional bowel disorder characterized by abdominal pain or diarrhoea and altered bowel habits, which correlate with intestinal hyperpermeability. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in regulating intestinal permeability in IBS-D. However, the role of miRNAs in regulating intestinal permeability and protecting the epithelial barrier remains unclear. Our goals were to (i) identify differential expression of miRNAs and their targets in the distal colon of IBS-D rats; (ii) verify in vitro whether occludin (OCLN) and zonula occludens 1 (ZO1/TJP1) were direct targets of miR-144 and were down-regulated in IBS-D rats; and (iii) determine whether down-regulation of miR-144 in vitro could reverse the pathological hallmarks of intestinal hyperpermeability via targeting OCLN and ZO1. Methods: The IBS-D rat model was established using 4% acetic acid and evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The distal colon was obtained in order to perform miRNA microarray analysis and to isolate and culture colonic epithelial cells. When differential expression of miRNA was found, the results were verified by qRT-PCR, and the target genes were further explored by bioinformatics analysis. Correlation analyses were carried out to compare the expression of miRNA and target genes. Then, mutants, miRNA mimics and inhibitors of the target genes were constructed and transfected to colonic epithelial cells. qRT-PCR, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and dual-luciferase assays were used to investigate the expression of miR-144 and OCLN, ZO1 in IBS-D rats. Results: There were 8 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated miRNAs identified in the IBS-D rat model. Of these, miR-144 was markedly up-regulated and resulted in the down-regulation of OCLN and ZO1 expression. Overexpression of miR-144 by transfection of miR-144 precursor markedly inhibited the expression of OCLN and ZO1. Further studies confirmed that OCLN and ZO1 were direct targets of miR-144. Additionally, intestinal hyperpermeability was enhanced by miR-144 up-regulation and attenuated by miR-144 down-regulation in IBS-D rat colonic epithelial cells. Moreover, rescue experiments showed that overexpression of OCLN and ZO1 significantly eliminated the inhibitory effect of miR-144, which showed a stronger effect on the attenuation of intestinal hyperpermeability. Conclusion: Up-regulation of miR-144 could promote intestinal hyperpermeability and impair the protective effect of the epithelial barrier by directly targeting OCLN and ZO1. miR-144 is likely a key regulator of intestinal hyperpermeability and could be a potential therapeutic target for IBS-D. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background More effective treatments are needed for patients with postinfectious, diarrhoea-predominant, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Accordingly, we conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week-long trial to assess the efficacy and safety of oral glutamine therapy in patients who developed IBS-D with increased intestinal permeability following an enteric infection. Methods Eligible adults were randomised to glutamine (5 g/t.i.d.) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was a reduction of ≥50 points on the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS-SS). Secondary endpoints included: raw IBS-SS scores, changes in daily bowel movement frequency, stool form (Bristol Stool Scale) and intestinal permeability. Results Fifty-four glutamine and 52 placebo subjects completed the 8-week study. The primary endpoint occurred in 43 (79.6%) in the glutamine group and 3 (5.8%) in the placebo group (a 14-fold difference). Glutamine also reduced all secondary endpoint means: IBS-SS score at 8 weeks (301 vs 181, p<0.0001), daily bowel movement frequency (5.4 vs 2.9±1.0, p<0.0001), Bristol Stool Scale (6.5 vs 3.9, p<0.0001) and intestinal permeability (0.11 vs 0.05; p<0.0001). 'Intestinal hyperpermeability' (elevated urinary lactulose/mannitol ratios) was normalised in the glutamine but not the control group. Adverse events and rates of study-drug discontinuation were low and similar in the two groups. No serious adverse events were observed. Conclusions In patients with IBS-D with intestinal hyperpermeability following an enteric infection, oral dietary glutamine supplements dramatically and safely reduced all major IBS-related endpoints. Large randomised clinical trials (RCTs) should now be done to validate these findings, assess quality of life benefits and explore pharmacological mechanisms.

AB  - Background/Aims: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were reported to be responsible for intestinal permeability in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) rats in our previous study. However, whether and how miRNAs regulate visceral hypersensitivity in IBS-D remains largely unknown. Methods: We established the IBS-D rat model and evaluated it using the nociceptive visceral hypersensitivity test, myeloperoxidase activity assay, restraint stress-induced defecation, and electromyographic (EMG) activity. The distal colon was subjected to miRNA microarray analysis followed by isolation and culture of colonic epithelial cells (CECs). Bioinformatic analysis and further experiments, including dual luciferase assays, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were used to detect the expression of miRNAs and how it regulates visceral hypersensitivity in IBS-D rats. Results: The IBS-D rat model was successfully established. A total of 24 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the distal colon of IBS-D rats; 9 were upregulated and 15 were downregulated. Among them, the most significant upregulation was miR-200a, accompanied by downregulation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) and serotonin transporter (SERT). MiR-200a mimic markedly inhibited the expression of CNR1/SERT. Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase assay confirmed that CNR1/SERT are direct targets of miR-200a. Rescue experiments that overexpressed CNR1/SERT significantly abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-200a on the IBS-D rats CECs. Conclusions: This study suggests that miR-200a could induce visceral hyperalgesia by targeting the downregulation of CNR1 and SERT, aggravating or leading to the development and progression of IBS-D. MiR-200a may be a regulator of visceral hypersensitivity, which provides potential targets for the treatment of IBS-D. © 2018 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

AB  - Background: Alteration of the host-microbiota cross talk at the intestinal barrier may participate in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, we aimed to determine effects of fecal luminal factors from IBS patients on the colonic epithelium using colonoids. Methods: Colon-derived organoid monolayers, colonoids, generated from a healthy subject, underwent stimulation with fecal supernatants from healthy subjects and IBS patients with predominant diarrhea, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cytokines in cell cultures and fecal LPS were measured by ELISA and mRNA gene expression of monolayers was analyzed using Qiagen RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays. The fecal microbiota profile was determined by the GA-map™ dysbiosis test and the fecal metabolite profile was analyzed by untargeted liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Key results: Colonoid monolayers stimulated with fecal supernatants from healthy subjects (n = 7), PBS (n = 4) or LPS (n = 3) presented distinct gene expression profiles, with some overlap (R2Y = 0.70, Q2= 0.43). Addition of fecal supernatants from healthy subjects and IBS patients (n = 9) gave rise to different gene expression profiles of the colonoid monolayers (R2Y = 0.79, Q2= 0.64). Genes (n = 22) related to immune response (CD1D, TLR5) and barrier integrity (CLDN15, DSC2) contributed to the separation. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines in colonoid monolayer cultures were comparable when stimulated with fecal supernatants from either donor types. Fecal microbiota and metabolite profiles, but not LPS content, differed between the study groups. Conclusions: Fecal luminal factors from IBS patients induce a distinct colonic epithelial gene expression, potentially reflecting the disease pathophysiology. The culture of colonoids from healthy subjects with fecal supernatants from IBS patients may facilitate the exploration of IBS related intestinal micro-environmental and barrier interactions. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background & Aims: Stressful life events are supposed to be involved in various diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome. Impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier function is a suspected consequence of stress, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the mechanisms through which stress modulates the colonic epithelial barrier. Methods: Cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was evaluated in murine colon, liver, and spleen by competitive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction after 1-4 days of daily 2-hour stress sessions. Colonic paracellular permeability was measured as the in vivo lumen-to-blood ratio of 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The effect of a myosin light chain (MLC) kinase inhibitor (ML-7) was assessed on stress-induced interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA expression and colonic epithelial barrier impairment, and MLC phosphorylation was determined by immunoblot. Finally, the incidence of repeated stress sessions on bacterial translocation was determined. Results: Repeated stress induced an overexpression of colonic IFN-γ. In the liver, higher levels of IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10 mRNAs were detected and were associated with bacterial translocation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Stress increased colonic permeability of control mice, but not of SCID and IFN-γ-deficient mice. ML-7 inhibited the stress-induced increased permeability, bacterial translocation, and cytokine overexpression in the liver and restored a normal histology. Larger amounts of phosphorylated MLC were detected in stressed animals. Conclusions: Repeated stress sessions drive organ-specific cytokine expression patterns and alter colonic mucosal barrier functions associated with bacterial translocation. This effect depends on the presence of CD4+ T cells and requires IFN-γ production and MLC phosphorylation.

AB  - Background: Momordica charantia exerts anti-inflammatory effect against ulcerative colitis. Momordica charantia polysaccharides (MCPs) attenuate gastritis through inhibition of ethanol-induced inflammatory response. Objective: The role of MCPs in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is investigated. Materials and Methods: Chemical stimulation followed by acute and chronic pressure stimulation was used to establish rats model with IBS-D. The model rats were then administrated with MCPs. Defecation frequency, fecal water content and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score were then recorded. Pathologic changes in the colonic tissues were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Inflammation was detected by ELISA and qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry was used to assess intestinal mucosal permeability. Results: First, IBS-D of mice wasIBS-D ratsmice exhibited many abnormal clinical manifestations, including increased frequency of defecation, fecal water content, and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score. Second, the mice were administrated with MCPs, which reduced frequency of defecation, fecal water content, and AWR score, and 100-mg/kg MCPs indicated therapeutic effect on IBS-D mice equivalent to rifaximin. Moreover, MCPs also ameliorated pathologic changes in the colonic tissues of IBS-D mice. Third, inflammatory response in IBS-D mice was also suppressed by MCPs through up-regulation of Interleukin (IL)-10, and downregulation of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), Interleukin(IL)-1B, and IL-6. MCPs enhanced levels of occludin (OCLN) and zona occludens protein-1 (ZO-1) in IBS-D mice to improve intestinal mucosal permeability. Finally, phosphorylation of p65 in IBS-D mice was reduced by MCP treatment. Conclusion: MCPs ameliorated intestinal permeability and repressed intestinal inflammation to attenuate IBS-D by inactivating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling © 2022. Codon Publications.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most frequent functional gastrointestinal disorder. It is characterized by abdominal hypersensitivity, leading to discomfort and pain, as well as altered bowel habits. While it is common for IBS to develop following the resolution of infectious gastroenteritis [then termed postinfectious IBS (PI-IBS)], the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Giardia duodenalis is a cosmopolitan water-borne enteropathogen that causes intestinal malabsorption, diarrhea, and postinfectious complications. Cause-and-effect studies using a human enteropathogen to help investigate the mechanisms of PI-IBS are sorely lacking. In an attempt to establish causality between giardiasis and postinfectious visceral hypersensitivity, this study describes a new model of PI-IBS in neonatal rats infected with G. duodenalis. At 50 days postinfection with G. duodenalis (assemblage A or B), long after the parasite was cleared, rats developed visceral hypersensitivity to luminal balloon distension in the jejunum and rectum, activation of the nociceptive signaling pathway (increased c-fos expression), histological modifications (villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia), and proliferation of mucosal intraepithelial lymphocytes and mast cells in the jejunum, but not in the rectum. G. duodenalis infection also disrupted the intestinal barrier, in vivo and in vitro, which in turn promoted the translocation of commensal bacteria. Giardia-induced bacterial paracellular translocation in vitro correlated with degradation of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-4. The extensive observations associated with gut hypersensitivity described here demonstrate that, indeed, in this new model of postgiardiasis IBS, alterations to the gut mucosa and c-fos are consistent with those associated with PI-IBS and, hence, offer avenues for new mechanistic research in the field. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC. is a widely used traditional herb that is well known for treating spleen deficiency and diarrhea. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is caused by cold and dampness, resulting in diarrhea and abdominal pain. Nevertheless, the effect and mechanism of Atractylodes on IBS-D are still unclear. Aim of the study: This study was designed to confirm the therapeutic effect of Atractylodes lanceolata oil (AO) in a rat model of IBS-D, and to determine the mechanisms by which AO protects against the disease. Materials and methods: The chemical components in AO were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The expression levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and surfactant protein (SP) in serum and colon tissue were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to elucidate the mechanism of action of AO toward inflammation and the intestinal barrier in a rat model of IBS-D. Results: The 15 chemical substances of the highest concentration in AO were identified using GC-MS. AO was effective against IBS-D in the rat model, in terms of increased body weight, diarrhea grade score, levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), aquaporin 3 (AQP3), and aquaporin 8 (AQP8), and reduced fecal moisture content, levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), 5-HT, VIP, and SP, while also reducing intestinal injury, as observed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. In addition, the results indicated that AO increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of stem cell factor (SCF) and c-kit and enhanced the levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, as well as decreased the levels of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and inhibited the phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 (p-MLC2). Conclusions: AO was found to be efficacious in the rat model of IBS-D. AO inhibited the SCF/c-kit pathway, thereby reducing inflammation and protecting against intestinal barrier damage via the MLCK/MLC2 pathway. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background & aims: Increased intestinal permeability of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients has been recently associated with a decreased level of glutamine synthetase. Neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) is considered as an IBS-like model. The aim of our study was to investigate whether early nutritional intervention with glutamine may attenuate the deleterious impact of early life stress on gut barrier function in NMD. Methods: 124 rat pups were separated from their dam 3 h daily during postnatal days 2-14, or left undisturbed (NS). Separated rats received by gavage either with alanyl-glutamine (GLN), an isonitrogenous amino acid mix (AA, control) or an equal amount of drinking water (H2O). Production of cytokines was measured by multiplex, expression of COX-2, PPARγ, tight junction proteins and TLR4 by western blot. Intestinal permeability was studied by Lactulose/Mannitol test. Results: Treatment of pups with GLN or AA abolished the decrease in body weight observed in NMD. Treatment with GLN decreased in the colon (i) TLR4 expression at D20, (ii) IL-2 and -10 productions at D60 (iii) protein expression of occludin at D20 compared to AA. GLN also decreased colon expression of COX2 and PPARγ at D60 compared to NS. Colon production of IFNγ is significantly reduced by GLN compared to H2O. No significant change in intestinal permeability was observed. Conclusions: These results showed that an early nutritional intervention with alanyl-glutamine specifically abolished the up-regulation of TLR4 expression in NMD. Glutamine may be evaluated as a potential treatment for IBS patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

AB  - Background and Aim: Emerging evidence indicates that psychological stress is involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, which is characterized by visceral hypersensitivity and may be accompanied by gut dysbiosis. However, how such stress contributes to the development of visceral hypersensitivity is incompletely understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the influence that stress-induced microbial changes exert on visceral sensitivity, as well as the possible underlying mechanisms associated with this effect. Methods: Male Sprague–Dawley rats underwent chronic water avoidance stress (WAS) to induce visceral hypersensitivity. Visceral sensitivity, colonic tight junction protein expression, and short-chain fatty acids of cecal contents were measured. Fecal samples were collected to characterize microbiota profiles. In a separate study, oral gavage of Roseburia in WAS rats was conducted to verify its potential role in the effectiveness on visceral hypersensitivity. Results: Repeated WAS caused visceral hypersensitivity, altered fecal microbiota composition and function, and decreased occludin expression in the colon. Stressed rats exhibited reduced representation of pathways involved in the metabolism of butyrate and reduced abundance of several operational taxonomic units associated with butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Lachnospiraceae. Consistently, supplementation with Roseburia hominis, a species belonging to Lachnospiraceae, significantly increased cecal butyrate content. Moreover, Roseburia supplementation alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and prevented the decreased expression of occludin. Conclusions: Reduction in the abundance of butyrate-producing Lachnospiraceae, which is beneficial for the intestinal barrier, was involved in the formation of visceral hypersensitivity. R. hominis is a potential probiotic for treating stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Paeoniflorin has been traditionally used to treat pain and immunologic derangement in China. However, its detailed mechanism remains to be illuminated. We investigated the mechanism by which paeoniflorin alleviates the inflammatory response in a mouse model of irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D). C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and miR-29a knockout (KO) mice were randomly divided into control, model, rifaximin, and paeoniflorin groups (n = 7). IBS-D model was induced by single intracolonic instillation of 0.1 mL trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS, 50 mg/mL) combined with restraint stress for seven consecutive days. The treatment groups received rifaximin (100 mg/kg) and paeoniflorin (50 mg/kg) via intragastric administration for seven days, respectively. The results showed that the fecal water content, fecal pellet output, visceral sensitivity, and histopathological score after paeoniflorin treatment were lower than those of the model group in both WT and miR-29a KO mice (P < 0.05). In both lineage mice, damage was observed in the colon tissues of model group, while paeoniflorin treatment partially ameliorated the tissue damage. Serum levels of DAO, DLA, IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, and MPO were decreased after paeoniflorin treatment (P < 0.05), with miR-29a KO mice in a lower level compared with that of WT mice. RT-PCR showed that the relative expression of miR-29a, NF-κB (p65), NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α was downregulated while NKRF was upregulated after paeoniflorin treatment (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that intestinal epithelial protein levels of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 decreased while those of Claudin-1 and ZO-1 increased in the paeoniflorin treatment group (P < 0.05). In general, compared with WT mice, NLRP3 inflammasome pathway targets was in much lower expression level than miR-29a KO mice. In conclusion, paeoniflorin could inhibit abnormal activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway by inhibiting miR-29a in IBS-D, thereby relieving the inflammatory response of the intestinal mucosa and reconstructing the intestinal epithelial barrier. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Background Intestinal epithelial dysfunction is a common pathophysiologic feature in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and might be the link to its clinical manifestations. We previously showed that chronic psychosocial stress induces jejunal epithelial barrier dysfunction; however, whether this epithelial response is gender-specific and might thus explain the enhanced female susceptibility to IBS remains unknown. Methods Intestinal responses to acute stress were compared in age-matched groups of healthy women and men (n=10 each) experiencing low background stress. A 20-cm jejunal segment, was perfused with an isosmotic solution, and intestinal effluents were collected under basal conditions, for 15min during cold pain stress and for a 45-min recovery period. Epithelial function (net water flux and albumin output), changes in stress hormones, and cardiovascular and psychologic responses to cold stress were measured. Key Results Heart rate and blood pressure significantly increased during cold pain stress with no differences between men and women. Adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels during cold pain stress were significantly higher in men. Basal net water flux and epithelial permeability were similar in men and women. Cold pain stress increased water flux in both groups (72±23 and 107±18μLmin-1cm-1, respectively; F(5, 90)=5.5; P=0.003 for Time) and, interestingly, this was associated with a marked increase of albumin permeability in women but not in men (0.8±0.2 vs.-0.7±0.2mg/15min; P<0.0001). Conclusions & Inferences Intestinal macromolecular permeability in response to acute experimental stress is increased in healthy women, a mechanism that may contribute to female oversusceptibility to IBS. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background & Aims Rifaximin is used to treat patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders, but little is known about its therapeutic mechanism. We propose that rifaximin modulates the ileal bacterial community, reduces subclinical inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, and improves gut barrier function to reduce visceral hypersensitivity. Methods We induced visceral hyperalgesia in rats, via chronic water avoidance or repeat restraint stressors, and investigated whether rifaximin altered the gut microbiota, prevented intestinal inflammation, and improved gut barrier function. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 454 pyrosequencing were used to analyze bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA in ileal contents from the rats. Reverse transcription, immunoblot, and histologic analyses were used to evaluate levels of cytokines, the tight junction protein occludin, and mucosal inflammation, respectively. Intestinal permeability and rectal sensitivity were measured. Results Water avoidance and repeat restraint stress each led to visceral hyperalgesia, accompanied by mucosal inflammation and impaired mucosal barrier function. Oral rifaximin altered the composition of bacterial communities in the ileum (Lactobacillus species became the most abundant) and prevented mucosal inflammation, impairment to intestinal barrier function, and visceral hyperalgesia in response to chronic stress. Neomycin also changed the composition of the ileal bacterial community (Proteobacteria became the most abundant species). Neomycin did not prevent intestinal inflammation or induction of visceral hyperalgesia induced by water avoidance stress. Conclusions Rifaximin alters the bacterial population in the ileum of rats, leading to a relative abundance of Lactobacillus. These changes prevent intestinal abnormalities and visceral hyperalgesia in response to chronic psychological stress. © 2014 by the AGA Institute.

AB  - To investigate effects of berberine exerts on A20 expression and regulation of intestinal epithelial tight junctions via the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway in Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D). C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and A20 IEC-KO mice (48 each) were randomly divided into normal control (NC), model control (MC), rifaximin and berberine groups (12 mice per group). An experimental model of IBS-D was established using 4% acetic acid and evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. rifaximin and berberine mice were treated with rifaximin and berberine, respectively. Intestinal epithelial space of WT berberine mice improved more than A20 IEC-KO berberine mice compared to MC mice. WT berberine mice exhibited greater expression of A20 compared with MC mice(P < 0.01). TNF-α, NF-kB p65, MLCK, MLC, TRAF6 and RIP1 levels in A20 IEC-KO and WT berberine mice were all decreased compared to MC mice(P all<0.05). NF-κB p65, MLCK and TRAF6 levels were increased in A20 IEC-KO berberine mice as compared to WT berberine mice (P all<0.05). Intestinal epithelial levels of occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1 and F-actin increased in all berberine mice (P all<0.01-0.05), while occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 levels were lower in A20 IEC-KO berberine mice(P < 0.05). Berberine downregulates abnormal activation of the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway by upregulating expression of A20 in a mouse model of IBS-D, thereby protecting intestinal epithelial tight junctions and repairing the damage IBS-D causes to the intestinal epithelial barrier. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Objective: Our research was to detect the expression of aquaporins. NF-κB in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rat models' colon so as to find novel pathogenesisof IBS. Results: The expression of AQP1, AQP3, and AQP8 of IBS model group was downregulated while NF-κB p65 was up-regulated comparing with control group (p < 0.05), and the expression of AQP1, AQP3, and AQP8 of inhibitor group was up-regulated while NF-κB p65 was down-regulated comparing with IBS model group (p < 0.05). Materials and Methods: 18 adult female SD big rats were divided into three groups:the rats in control group were normal rats,the rats in IBS model group and the rats of inhibitor group were injected with the inhibitor of NF-κB (PDTC). Immunohistochemical technique and western blot were performed to detect the expression of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8 and NF-κB p65. RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of AQP1, AQP3, and AQP8. Conclusions: Liquid water metabolic abnormalities and intestine permeability alteration might be the mechanism of IBS by down-regulating AQP1, AQP3 and AQP8 via NF-κB pathway. © Chao et al.

AB  - We sought to explore the protective effect of the combination of fenchone (FE) and sodium hyaluronate (SH) on ice water-induced IBS-C rats and the potential mechanism. The neurotransmitter levels, including substance P (SP), motilin (MTL), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), were determined by ELISA methods. The stem cell factors (SCF)/c-Kit signaling pathway-related protein and mRNA levels were determined by western blot and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses, respectively. The expressions of tight ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 were also measured by western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining. The 16S rRNA gene sequence was used to measure the composition of gut microbiota. The co-administration of FE and SH improved the body weight, number of fecal pellets, fecal moisture, abdominal with drawal reflex score, and gastrointestinal transit rate in IBS-C rats. The unique efficacy of combination depended on the regulation of balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, enhancement of intestinal barrier function, and activation of SCF/c-Kit pathway. The gut microbiota structure was also restored. The ability of FE combined with SH to regulate SCF/c-Kit signaling pathway, enhance intestinal barrier function, and modulate gut microbiota contributes to their efficacy in managing IBS-C in rats. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate if berberine can act on vitamin D receptors (VDR) and thereby regulate the expression of tight junction proteins (TJPs) in irritable bowel syndrame-diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) rats. Methods: The newborn rats were induced into IBS-D rat model via neonatal maternal separation combined with acetic acid chemical stimulation. After modeling, the model was evaluated and rats were divided into the control group and berberine treatment groups (0.85, 1.7 and 3.4 mg/kg, once a day for 2 weeks). The distal colon was obtained and colonic epithelial cells (CECs) were isolated and cultured after IBS-D model evaluation. The vitamin D receptor response element (VDRE) reporter gene was determined in the CECs of IBS-D rats to analyze the effect of berberine on the VDRE promoter. VDR overexpression or silencing technology was used to analyze whether VDR plays a role in promoting intestinal barrier repair, and to determine which region of VDR plays a role in berberine-regulated intestinal TJPs. Results: The IBS-D rat model was successfully constructed and the symptoms were improved by berberine in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). The activity of VDRE promoter was also effectively promoted by berberine (P<0.05). Berberine increased the expression of TJPs in IBS-D CECs (P<0.05). VDR expression was significantly increased after transfection of different domains of VDR when compared to normal control and basic plasmid groups (all P<0.05). RT-qPCR and Western blot results showed that compared with the blank group, expressions of occludin and zonula occludens-1 were significantly higher in VDR containing groups (all P<0.05). Berberine plus pCMV-Myc-VDR-N group exerted the highest expression levels of occludin and zonula occludens-1 (P<0.05). Conclusion: Berberine enhances intestinal mucosal barrier function of IBS-D rats by promoting VDR activity, and the main site of action is the N-terminal region of VDR. © 2023, The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is frequently silenced in lung, prostate, liver, stomach, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and other forms of human carcinomas. However, it is unclear regarding the role of CADM1 in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) that is the most common gastrointestinal diagnosis and may contribute to impaired intestinal barrier function. The aim of the present study is to explore the potential mechanism of CADM1 in regulating intestinal barrier function in IBS-D. A rat model with IBS-D induced by the combination method of mother-infant separation, acetic acid and restraint stress was initially established. The defecation frequency, faecal water content (FWC), total intestinal permeability, sIgA, endotoxin, D-lactic acid and diamine oxidase (DAO) were then measured. Next, positive expression of CADM1 protein was detected in distal colonic tissue of rats by immunohistochemistry. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in distal colonic mucosa, CADM1, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), STAT3, p-JAK1, p-STAT3, Claudin-1and Claudin-2 were evaluated using ELISA, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. IBS-D rats exhibited low CADM1 expression and activated STAT3 signaling pathway. Overexpression of CADM1 in rats was shown to increase Claudin-1 expression, while decreasing expression of STAT3, Claudin-2, TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, silencing of CADM1 or inhibition of the STAT3 signaling pathway was demonstrated to improve the intestinal barrier function. Our study provides evidence that CADM1 can potentially improve intestinal barrier function in rats with IBS-D by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) is characterized by increased intestinal permeability. Previous studies have shown that the microRNA-29 gene is involved in the regulation of intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D. NF-κB was proved to play a key role in inflammatory response of intestine and resultant disruption of tight junction integrity, whose activity could be inhibited by TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3 (TRAF3). However, the exact mechanism that induces increased intestinal permeability in IBS-D patients has not been clarified. In this study, we found that microRNA-29b-3p (miR-29b-3p) was significantly upregulated, while TRAF3 was decreased and the NF-κB-MLCK pathway was activated within the colonic tissue of IBS-D patients. Subsequently, we confirmed the targeting relationship between miR-29b-3p and TRAF3 through a double-luciferase reporter assay. Lentivirus transfection of NCM460 cells with miR-29b-3p-overexpressing and -silencing vectors demonstrated that the expression of TRAF3 was negatively correlated with the level of miR-29b-3p. The NF-κB/MLCK pathway was activated in the miR-29b-3p-overexpressing group and inhibited to some extent in the miR-29b-3p-silencing group. Results in WT and miR-29 knockout mice showed that miR-29b-3p levels were increased, TRAF3 levels were decreased, and the NF-κB/MLCK signaling was activated in the WT IBS-D group as compared with the WT control group. The protein levels of TRAF3 and TJs in the miR-29b-/- IBS-D group were partially recovered and NF-κB/MLCK pathway indicators were, to a certain extent, decreased as compared with the WT IBS-D group. These results suggested that miR-29b-3p deletion enhances the TRAF3 level in IBS-D mice and alleviates the high intestinal permeability. In brief, through the analysis of intestinal tissue samples from IBS-D patients and miR-29b-/- IBS-D mice, we showed that miR-29b-3p is involved in the pathogenesis of intestinal hyperpermeability in IBS-D via targeting TRAF3 to regulate the NF-κB-MLCK signaling pathway.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder characterized by altered gut function and often is accompanied by comorbid anxiety. Although changes in the gut microbiota have been documented, their relevance to the clinical expression of IBS is unknown. To evaluate a functional role for commensal gut bacteria in IBS, we colonized germ-free mice with the fecal microbiota from healthy control individuals or IBS patients with diarrhea (IBS-D), with or without anxiety, and monitored gut function and behavior in the transplanted mice. Microbiota profiles in recipient mice clustered according to the microbiota profiles of the human donors. Mice receiving the IBS-D fecal microbiota showed a taxonomically similar microbial composition to that of mice receiving the healthy control fecal microbiota. However, IBS-D mice showed different serum metabolomic profiles. Mice receiving the IBS-D fecal microbiota, but not the healthy control fecal microbiota, exhibited faster gastrointestinal transit, intestinal barrier dysfunction, innate immune activation, and anxiety-like behavior. These results indicate the potential of the gut microbiota to contribute to both intestinal and behavioral manifestations of IBS-D and suggest the potential value of microbiota-directed therapies in IBS patients. © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.

AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenol compound present in plant foods. CGA is a differentially excreted gut microbial metabolite in fecal samples of irritable bowel syndrome model mice and normal control mice. Here, we aimed to clarify the protective effect of CGA on intestinal barrier function. We used Caco-2 cells to create an intestinal epithelial cell barrier model, and evaluated tight-junctional permeability with fluorescein isothiocyanate–dextran. We treated Caco-2 cells with lipopolysaccharide and CGA, and measured tight-junction protein expression, TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation, and proinflammatory cytokine levels. CGA blocked the NF-κB pathway by downregulating CD14 and p65, and preventing phospho-p65 from entering cell nuclei. CGA showed anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 production, and thereby restored intestinal epithelial tight-junction integrity. In conclusion, CGA was highly effective at preserving cell membrane integrity, and inhibited proinflammatory cytokine secretion by downregulating CD14 to block the NF-kB pathway. © 2021

AB  - Decreased serum vitamin D (VD) levels have been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). VD can also modulate the intestinal barrier. Given the link between the GI barrier’s alterations and diet, attention has aroused the positive effects of the Low FODMAP Diet (LFD) on IBS patients’ symptom profile. We evaluated the GI symptoms and the urinary and circulating markers of GI barrier function, the markers of inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis in 36 IBS patients with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) (5 men and 31 women, 43.1 ± 1.7 years) categorized for their circulating VD levels in low (L-VD) and normal (N-VD) (cutoff = 20 ng/mL). Evaluations were performed before and after 12 weeks of LFD. At the baseline, L-VD patients showed a significantly worse symptom profile and altered small intestinal permeability (s-IP) than N-VD. After LFD, a significant increase in the circulating VD levels in both the subgroups and a significant improvement of s-IP in L-VD patients occurred. Finally, VD levels negatively correlated with the symptom score and fecal zonulin. These data highlight the close relationship between VD and the intestinal barrier and support their involvement in IBS-D pathophysiology. Moreover, the potentially positive role of LFD in the management of IBS-D was confirmed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the effect of the probiotic combination Lactibiane Tolerance® (LT) on epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo Methods: The effect of the multispecies probiotic LT was assessed on several models of epithelial barrier function both in vitro (in basal and inflammatory conditions) and in vivo [visceral hypersensitivity induced by chronic stress or by colonic perfusion of a fecal supernatant (FSN) from patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)]. In vitro, we measured the permeability of confluent T84 cell monolayers incubated with or without LT by evaluating the paracellular flux of macromolecules, in basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or with conditioned medium of colonic biopsies from IBS patients (IBS-CM). In vivo, male C57/Bl6 mice received orally NaCl or LT for 15 d and were submitted to water avoidance stress (WAS) before evaluating visceral sensitivity by measuring the myoelectrical activity of the abdominal muscle and the paracellular permeability with 51Cr-EDTA. Permeability and sensitivity were also measured after colonic instillation of FSN. Tight-junctions were assessed by immunoblotting and TLR-4 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry Results: Incubation of T84 cell monolayers with LT in basal conditions had no significant effect on permeability (P > 0.05 vs culture medium). By contrast, addition of LT bacterial bodies (LT) completely prevented the LPS-induced increase in paracellular permeability (P < 0.01 vs LPS 10 ng/mL (LPS 10); P < 0.01 vs LPS 100 ng/mL (LPS 100), P > 0.05 vs culture medium). The effect was dose dependent as addition of 109 LT bacterial bodies induced a stronger decrease in absorbance than 106 LT (109 LT + LPS 10: -20.1% ± 13.4, P < 0.01 vs LPS 10; 106 LT + LPS 10: -11.6% ± 6.2, P < 0.01 vs LPS 10; 109 LT + LPS 100: -14.4% ± 5.5, P < 0.01 vs LPS 100; 106 LT + LPS 100: -11.6% ± 7.3, P < 0.05 vs LPS 100). Moreover, the increase in paracellular permeability induced by culturing T84 cells with conditioned medium of colonic biopsies from IBS patients (IBS-CM) was completely inhibited in the presence of 109 LT (P< 0.01 vs IBS-CM). LT also significantly prevented the epithelial disruption induced by intracolonic infusion of fecal supernatant from IBS patients (P < 0.01 vs IBS FSN) or water avoidance stress P < 0.01 vs WAS) in C57/Bl6 mice and increased the expression of occludin in vitro and in vivo, as assessed by immnunoblotting. The WAS-induced effect on visceral sensitivity was prevented by LT treatment since values obtained for all steps of colorectal distension were significantly (P < 0.01) different from the WAS group. Finally, LT downregulated the response mediated through TLR-4 in vitro (decrease in tumor necrosis factor α secretion in response to LPS: -65.8% for 109 LT and -52.5% for 106 LT, P < 0.01 vs LPS) and in vivo (inhibition of WAS induced an increase in TLR-4 expression in the LT treated mice colon, P < 0.01 vs WAS). Conclusion: The probiotic LT mix prevented the disruption to the epithelial barrier induced by LPS, stress or colonic soluble factors from IBS patients and prevented visceral hypersensitivity. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorder. Although the main reason for IBS is not clear, the interaction between intestinal microorganisms and the gut barrier seems to play an important role in pathogenesis of IBS. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of Blastocystis on the gut microbiota profile and the circulation levels of microRNA (mir)-16 of IBS patients compared to healthy subjects. Stool and blood samples were collected from 80 participants including 40 samples from each IBS and healthy group. Upon DNA extraction from stool samples, barcoding region and quantitative real-time PCR were analyzed to investigate Blastocystis and the microbiota profile, respectively. RNA was extracted from serum samples of included subjects and the expression of mir-16 was evaluated using stem-loop protocol and qreal-time PCR. Significant changes between IBS patients and healthy controls was observed in Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Faecalibacterium, and Alistipes. In IBS patients, the relative abundance of Bifidobacteria was directly correlated with the presence of Blastocystis, while Alistipes was decreased with Blastocystis. Lactobacillus was significantly increased in Blastocystis carriers. In healthy subjects, the relative abundance of Bifidobacteria was decreased, but Alistipes was increased in Blastocystis carriers. The changes in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was not significant in different groups. The relative expression of mir-16 in Blastocystis-negative IBS patients and healthy carriers was significantly overexpressed compared to control group. The presence of Blastocystis, decreased the relative expression of mir-16 in IBS patients compared to Blastocystis-negative IBS patients. The present study revealed that Blastocystis has the ability to change the abundance of some phyla/genera of bacteria in IBS and healthy subjects. Moreover, Blastocystis seems to modulate the relative expression of microRNAs to control the gut atmosphere, apply its pathogenicity, and provide a favor niche for its colonization. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Aim. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial functional bowel disorder characterized by disruption of the intestinal barrier. Circulating exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in regulating epithelial barrier function, and upregulation of miR-148b-5p has been detected in IBS. However, whether exosomal miR-148-5p is involved in the IBS pathogenesis remains unclear. This study was aimed at investigating the relationship of exosomal miR-148-5p with colonic epithelial permeability. Methods. Exosomes were isolated from the serum of IBS patients and healthy controls. HT-29 cells were cultured with the IBS-derived serum exosomes (IBS-exo). Exosome uptake assay was used to evaluate whether the IBS-exo could be absorbed by HT-29 cells. FITC-Dextran flux and transepithelial/endothelial electrical resistance were measured to evaluate epithelial permeability. A luciferase reporter assay was used to determine whether the regulator of G protein signaling- (RGS-) 2 is a target gene of miR-148b-5p. Results. miR-148b-5p was obviously elevated in the IBS-exo compared to the control-exo. Upregulation of miR-148b-5p was observed in the HT-29 cells cultured with IBS-exo. Exposure to IBS-exo increased cell permeability and decreased RGS2 expression. The IBS-exo-induced alterations were obviously reversed by interfering with the miR-148b-5p expression. Mimicking the IBS-exo treatment, miR-148b-5p overexpression increased cell permeability and downregulated RGS2 expression, which were abrogated by overexpressing RGS2. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that RGS2 was a direct target of miR-148b-5p. Conclusions. Serum-derived exosomes from IBS patients increase colonic epithelial permeability via miR-148b-5p/RGS2 signaling.  © 2021 Ying Xing et al.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of Chang’an II Decoction (肠安 II 号方))-containing serum on intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in rats. Methods: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced injury of Caco-2 monolayers were established as an inflammatory model of human intestinal epithelium. Caco-2 monolayers were treated with blank serum and Chang’an II Decoction-containing serum that obtained from the rats which were treated with distilled water and Chang’an II Decoction intragastrically at doses of 0.49, 0.98, 1.96 g/(kg·d) for 1 week, respectively. After preparation of containing serum, cells were divided into the normal group, the model group, the Chang’an II-H, M, and L groups (treated with 30 ng/mL TNF-α and medium plus 10% high, middle-, and low-doses Chang’an II serum, respectively). Epithelial barrier function was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and permeability of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructure of tight junctions (TJs). Immunofluorescence of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin-1 and nuclear transcription factor-kappa p65 (NF-κ Bp65) were measured to determine the protein distribution. The mRNA expression of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of MLCK, myosin light chain (MLC) and p-MLC were determined by Western blot. Results: Chang’an II Decoction-containing serum significantly attenuated the TER and paracellular permeability induced by TNF-α. It alleviated TNF-α-induced morphological alterations in TJ proteins. The increases in MLCK mRNA and MLCK, MLC and p-MLC protein expressions induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited in the Chang’an II-H group. Additionally, Chang’an II Decoction significantly attenuated translocation of NF-κ Bp65 into the nucleus. Conclusion: High-dose Chang’an II-containing serum attenuates TNF-α-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. The underlying mechanism may be involved in inhibiting the MLCK-MLC phosphorylation signaling pathway mediated by NF-κ Bp65. © 2019, The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (LFD) improves both gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the psychological profile of patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). The effects of 12 weeks of LFD on GI symptom and psychological profiles in relation to inflammation and the involvement of the intestinal barrier were studied in twenty IBS-D patients. The IBS Severity Scoring System, the Symptom Checklist-90-Re-vised, the Italian version of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, the IBS-Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire, and the Psychophysiological questionnaire were administered. The GI barrier function was assessed by sugar absorption test, the serum and fecal zonulin levels, and the serum levels of intestinal fatty-acid binding protein and diamine oxidase. Interleukins (ILs) and lipopolysaccha-ride (LPS) serum levels were evaluated along with dysbiosis. At the end of LFD, GI symptoms, psychological state (mainly anxiety, somatization, psychoticism, and interpersonal sensitivity), and QoL significantly improved in these patients. Simultaneously, an improvement in small intestinal permeability and intestinal mucosal integrity occurred, while IL-6, Il-10, LPS, and fermentative dysbiosis significantly decreased. The LFD can modify the immune-inflammatory features and en-hance intestinal permeability and mucosal integrity, thus determining a concurrent improvement in the clinical and psychological conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several intestinal diseases, including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The present research was carried out to investigate the protective effect of total polysaccharides of adlay bran (TPA) on TNF-α-evoked epithelial barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells were treated with or without TPA in the absence or presence of TNF-α, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and Phenol Red flux were assayed to evaluate the intestinal epithelial barrier function. The results indicated that TPA suppressed the TNF-α-induced release of pro-inflammatory factors. Furthermore, TPA obviously assuaged both the increased paracellular permeability and the decrease of TEER in TNF-α-challenged Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, TPA obviously assuaged TNF-α-evoked up-regulation of IL-8 and IL-6 expression, down-regulation of occludin and ZO-3 expression, and markedly suppressed the activation and protein expression of NF-κB p65. Our results indicated that TPA assuages the TNF-α-evoked dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier by inhibiting the NF-κB p65-mediated inflammatory response. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: A probiotic mixture prevented epithelial barrier impairment in various experimental models. The objective was to evaluate its effects in patients suffering from IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) with confirmed leaky gut. Methods: IBS-D patients with increased intestinal permeability measured by radionuclide tracers were enrolled in this pilot, open-label, prospective, interventional, single-center, Phase IV study. Patients received two capsules of a multistrain probiotic a day for 30 days and were evaluated by repeated intestinal permeability tests, the Bristol Stool Scale, and patient-perceived quality of life and satisfaction. Results: Of the 30 enrolled patients (mean age: 42.1 [SD: 13.1] years; female: 60%), 27 completed the study (full analysis set [FAS]), and 18 had no major protocol violation (per protocol set [PPS]). On D30, an improvement of intestinal permeability was observed in 81.5% of patients in FAS, normalization being observed in 37% of the participants (44% in PPS). The mean intestinal permeability was significantly decreased: baseline minus D30, 3.4 (95% CI: 1.7, 5.2); the IBS-QOL total score was significantly increased: D30 minus baseline, 8.0 (95% CI: 3.0, 12.9); and stool consistency was significantly improved. On D15 and D30, 96.3% of patients claimed that their IBS symptoms had been satisfactory alleviated, and a significant improvement was reported for the following VAS-IBS items: abdominal pain, diarrhea, and impact of gastrointestinal problems in daily life. Compliance and tolerance were satisfactory. Conclusion: The multistrain probiotic tested may reduce intestinal permeability in a considerable proportion of patients and may improve abdominal pain, stool consistency, and quality of life. These results pave the way for larger, placebo-controlled clinical studies.  © 2023 S. Karger AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fagopyrum cymosum (Trev.) Meisn (Fag) is a herb rhizome which has been widely used to treat diseases. To investigate the effects and mechanisms of the Fag on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), in vivo neonatal pups maternal separation (NMS) combined with intracolonic infusion of acetic acid (AA) was employed to establish IBS rat models. Fag reduced their visceral hyperalgesia and the whole gut permeability, ameliorated colonic mucosa inflammation and injury, and upregulated the expression of decreased tight junction proteins (TJs) of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 (except ZO-2) in colonic epithelium. Caco-2 monolayer cells were incubated with TNF-α and IFN-γ in vitro to establish an epithelial barrier dysfunction model whose transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) depended more on dose of Fag than that of the controls, and whose TJs levels were lower than those of the controls. Fag upregulated the NP-40 insoluble and soluble components of the four TJs markedly in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that Fag alleviated the hyperalgesia of IBS rats by reducing intestinal inflammation and enhancing mucosal epithelial function after regulating the structure and function of TJs. © 2012 Lina Liu et al.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a multifactorial intestinal disorder, is often associated with a disruption in intestinal permeability as well as an increased expression of pro-inflammatory markers. The aim of this study was to first test the impact of treatment with glutamine (Gln), a food supplement containing natural curcumin extracts and polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (Cur); bioactive peptides from a fish protein hydrolysate (Ga); and a probiotic mixture containing Bacillus coagulans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus helveticus. These compounds were tested alone on a stress-based IBS model, the chronic-restraint stress model (CRS). The combination of Gln, Cur and Ga (GCG) was also tested. Eight-week-old C57Bl/6 male mice were exposed to restraint stress for two hours every day for four days and received different compounds every day one week before and during the CRS procedure. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured as a marker of stress, and colonic permeability was evaluated ex vivo in Ussing chambers. Changes in the gene expression of tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-1 and ZO 1) and inflammatory cytokines (IL1β, TNFα, CXCL1 and IL10) were assessed using RT-qPCR. The CRS model led to an increase in plasma corticosterone and an increase in colonic permeability compared with unstressed animals. No change in plasma corticosterone concentrations was observed in response to CRS with the different treatments (Gln, Cur, Ga or GCG). Stressed animals treated with Gln, Cur and Ga alone and in combination showed a decrease in colonic permeability when compared to the CRS group, while the probiotic mixture resulted in an opposite response. The Ga treatment induced an increase in the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and the GCG treatment was able to decrease the expression of CXCL1, suggesting the synergistic effect of the combined mixture. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a combined administration of glutamine, a food supplement containing curcumin and polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids, and bioactive peptides from a fish hydrolysate was able to reduce colonic hyperpermeability and reduce the inflammatory marker CXCL1 in a stress-based model of IBS and could be of interest to patients suffering from IBS. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) and mast cell (MC) mediators contribute to inflammatory and functional gastrointestinal disorders. We aimed to characterize jejunal PAR-2-mediated responses and the potential MC involvement in the early and late phases of a rat model of postinfectious gut dysfunction. Jejunal tissues of control and Trichinella spiralis-infected (14 and 30 days postinfection) rats, treated or not with the MC stabilizer, ketotifen, were used. Histopathology and immunostaining were used to characterize inflammation, PAR-2 expression, and mucosal and connective tissue MCs. Epithelial barrier function (hydroelectrolytic transport and permeability) and motility were assessed in vitro in basal conditions and after PAR-2 activation. Intestinal inflammation on day 14 postinfection (early phase) was significantly resolved by day 30 (late phase) although MC counts and epithelial permeability remained increased. PAR-2-mediated ion transport (Ussing chambers, in vitro) and epithelial surface PAR-2 expression were reduced in the early phase, with a trend toward normalization during the late phase. In control conditions, PAR-2 activation (organ bath) induced biphasic motor responses (relaxation followed by excitation). At 14 days postinfection, spontaneous contractility and PAR-2-mediated relaxations were enhanced; motor responses were normalized on day 30. Postinfectious changes in PAR-2 functions were not affected by ketotifen treatment. We concluded that, in the rat model of Trichinella spiralis infection, alterations of intestinal PAR-2 function and expression depend on the inflammatory phase considered. A lack of a ketotifen effect suggests no interplay between MCs and PAR-2-mediated motility and ion transport alterations. These observations question the role of MC mediators in PAR-2-modulating postinfectious gut dysfunction. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background Alterations in gastrointestinal (GI) permeability and immune measures are present in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but the relationship to symptoms is poorly defined. In adults with IBS, we compared permeability, unstimulated peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC) interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, IBS life interference, and GI and psychological distress symptoms. Methods In 88 women and 18 men with IBS, GI permeability was quantitated as percent recovery of urinary sucrose and the lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio. IL-10 was measured in supernatants from 72-h incubated, unstimulated PBMCs. Participants completed a 4-week daily diary recording IBS life interference on daily activities and work, IBS symptoms, and psychological distress symptoms. They also completed the Brief Symptom Inventory. Results The L/M ratio but not percent sucrose recovery was significantly correlated with IBS interference with activities and work and retrospectively measured anxiety and depression. Unstimulated PBMC production of IL-10 correlated significantly with IBS interference with daily work, IBS symptom score, and abdominal pain. We identified a subgroup of IBS subjects with higher IL-10 and/or higher L/M ratio who had substantially higher IBS interference and IBS symptom scores. Conclusions Our findings suggest a distinct subgroup of IBS patients with alterations in gut barrier function. This subgroup is characterized by increased GI permeability and/or increased PBMC production of IL-10. These physiologic alterations reflect more severe IBS as measured by interference of IBS with daily activities and daily IBS symptoms. © 2014 Springer Japan.

AB  - Previous in vitro studies have shown that the intestinal luminal content, including metabolites, possibly regulates epithelial layer responses to harmful stimuli and promotes disease. Therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that fecal supernatants from patients with colon cancer (CC), ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) contain distinct metabolite profiles and establish their effects on Caco-2 cells and human-derived colon organoids (colonoids). The metabolite profiles of fecal supernatants were analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and distinguished patients with CC (n = 6), UC (n = 6), IBS (n = 6) and healthy subjects (n = 6). Caco-2 monolayers and human apical-out colonoids underwent stimulation with fecal supernatants from different patient groups and healthy subjects. Their addition did not impair monolayer integrity, as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance; however, fecal supernatants from different patient groups and healthy subjects altered the gene expression of Caco-2 monolayers, as well as colonoid cultures. In conclusion, the stimulation of Caco-2 cells and colonoids with fecal supernatants derived from CC, UC and IBS patients altered gene expression profiles, potentially reflecting the luminal microenvironment of the fecal sample donor. This experimental approach allows for investigating the crosstalk at the gut barrier and the effects of the gut microenvironment in the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Life stress and mucosal inflammation may influence symptom onset and severity in certain gastrointestinal disorders, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), in connection with dysregulated intestinal barrier. However, the mechanism responsible remains unknown. Crowding is a validated animal model reproducing naturalistic psychosocial stress, whose consequences on gut physiology remain unexplored. Our aims were to prove that crowding stress induces mucosal inflammation and intestinal dysfunction, to characterize dynamics in time, and to evaluate the implication of stress-induced mast cell activation on intestinal dysfunction. Wistar-Kyoto rats were submitted to 15 days of crowding stress (8 rats/cage) or sham-crowding (2 rats/cage). We measured spontaneous and corticotropin-releasing factor-mediated release of plasma corticosterone. Stress-induced intestinal chrono-pathobiology was determined by measuring intestinal inflammation, epithelial damage, mast cell activation and infiltration, and intestinal barrier function. Corticosterone release was higher in crowded rats throughout day 15. Stress-induced mild inflammation, manifested earlier in the ileum and the colon than in the jejunum. While mast cell counts remained mostly unchanged, piecemeal degranulation increased along time, as the mucosal content and luminal release of rat mast cell protease-II. Stress-induced mitochondrial injury and increased jejunal permeability, both events strongly correlated with mast cell activation at day 15. Taken together, we have provided evidences that long-term exposure to psychosocial stress promotes mucosal inflammation and mast cell-mediated barrier dysfunction in the rat bowel. The notable resemblance of these findings with those in some IBS patients, support the potential interest and translational validity of this experimental model for the research of stress-sensitive intestinal disorders, particularly IBS. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To determine gastrointestinal (GI) permeability and fecal calprotectin concentration in children 7 to 10 years of age with functional abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome (FAP/IBS) versus control subjects and ascertain potential relationships with pain symptoms and stooling. Study design: GI permeability and fecal calprotectin concentration were measured. Children kept a 2-week diary of pain episodes and stooling pattern. Results: Proximal GI permeability was greater in the FAP/IBS group (n = 93) compared with control subjects (n = 52) (0.59 ± 0.50 vs 0.36 ± 0.26, respectively; mean ± SD; P < .001) as was colonic permeability (1.01 ± 0.67 vs 0.81 ± 0.43, respectively; P < .05). Gastric and small intestinal permeability were similar. Fecal calprotectin concentration was greater in children with FAP/IBS compared with control children (65.5 ± 75.4 μg/g stool vs 43.2 ± 39.4, respectively; P < .01). Fecal calprotectin concentration correlated with pain interference with activities (P = .01, r2 = 0.36). There was no correlation between GI permeability and pain related symptoms. Neither permeability nor fecal calprotectin correlated with stool form. Conclusions: Children with FAP/IBS have evidence of increased GI permeability and low-grade GI inflammation, with the latter relating to the degree to which pain interferes with activities. © 2008 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Disruption of intestinal barrier homeostasis is an important pathogenic factor in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) improves IBS symptoms through unclear mechanisms. Previous studies utilizing colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines showed that LGG metabolites prevented interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) induced barrier damage but the model employed limited these findings. We aimed to interrogate the protective effects of LGG on epithelial barrier function using human intestinal epithelial cultures (enteroids and colonoids) as a more physiologic model. To investigate how LGG affects epithelial barrier function, we measured FITC-Dextran (FD4) flux across the epithelium as well as tight junction zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and occludin (OCLN) expression. Colonoids were incubated with fecal supernatants from IBS patients (IBS-FSN) and healthy controls in the presence or absence of LGG to examine changes in gut permeability. Enteroids incubated with IFN-gamma demonstrated a downregulation of OCLN and ZO-1 expression by 67% and 50%, respectively (p<0.05). This was accompanied by increased paracellular permeability as shown by leakage of FD4. Pretreatment of enteroids with LGG prevented these changes and normalized OCLN and ZO-1 to control levels. These actions were independent of its action against apoptosis. However, these protective effects were not seen with LGG cell wall extracts, LGG DNA, or denatured (boiled) LGG. Intriguingly, IBS-FSN injected into colonoids increased paracellular permeability, which was prevented by LGG. LGG, likely due to secreted proteins, protects against epithelial barrier dysfunction. Bacterial-derived factors to modulate gut barrier function may be a treatment option in disorders such as IBS. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common functional gastrointestinal disease. Besides, baizhu shaoyao decoction (BSD) is an effective treatment for IBS-D; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Purpose: This study aims to assess the ability of BSD to therapy IBS-D and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Methods: First, comprehensive analyses, including ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) screening, Venn analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, and network construction, were performed to characterize IBS-D-related pathways and explore the synergistic effects of BSD active compounds. Next, an IBS-D model was constructed using a three-factor superposition method of neonatal maternal separation, chronic immobilization stress stimulation, and Sennae folium aqueous extract lavage. Moreover, the impact of BSD was assessed based on the body weight, fecal water content, and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR), and the results of the open field test, sucrose preference test, intestinal permeability assessment, transmission electron microscopy, and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) analysis. The factors that regulate the BSD effects on IBS-D were estimated using immunoblotting, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RTPCR), immunohistochemistry, and transcriptome sequencing analyses. Results: We found that BSD improved depressive behavior, brain–gut peptide levels, and intestinal permeability induced by IBS-D by increasing the abundance of intestinal tight junctions. In addition, BSD reduced secretory immunoglobulin A levels and the number of intestinal mast cells in IBS-D rats. Network pharmacology and transcriptome sequencing analysis further revealed that the forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling pathway contributed to the BSD-induced alleviation of IBS-D, as BSD regulated the protein and mRNA levels of FoxO1, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and FoxO3a. Importantly, a FoxO1 inhibitor effectively alleviated IBS-D symptoms in rats, whereas a FoxO3a agonist had the opposite effects. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that BSD alleviates depression and intestinal symptoms by regulating brain–gut peptide expression and restoring the intestinal barrier function via the FoxO signaling pathway. Furthermore, our study uses serum pharmacochemistry technology to analyze the in vivo components of TCM formula under effective condition, solving the problem of the discovery of the effective components of TCM to some extent. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) ES1 is a probiotic strain capable of modulating microbiome composition, anti-inflammatory activity and intestinal barrier function. We investigated the use of B. Longum ES1 in the treatment of patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Sixteen patients were treated for 8 or 12 weeks with B. Longum ES1 (1 × 109 CFU/day). Serum zonulin and cytokines were measured at baseline (T0) and at the end of therapy (T1). Clinical response to therapy was assessed by IBS Severity Scoring System. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-12p70 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α levels decreased from T0 to T1, irrespective of treatment duration (p < 0.05), while zonulin levels diminished only in patients treated for 12 weeks (p = 0.036). Clinical response was observed in 5/16 patients (31%): 4/8 (50%) treated for 12 weeks and 1/8 (13%) treated for 8 weeks. Abdominal pain improved only in patients treated for 12 weeks (5/8 vs. 0/8, p = 0.025), while stool consistency improved regardless of therapy duration (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the results of this pilot study showed, in IBS-D patients treated for 12 weeks with B. longum ES1, a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and intestinal permeability as well as an improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms, but further studies including a placebo-control group are necessary to prove a causal link. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Changji'an Formula (CJAF) is a Chinese herbal compound, which is effective against irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) in clinic. However, the molecular mechanism has not been well defined. In the current study, the potential targets and signaling pathways of CJAF against IBS-D were predicted using network pharmacology analysis. The pharmacological mechanisms of CJAF against IBS-D and the potential mechanism were validated by using an IBS-D mouse model induced by enema with trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) plus with restraint stress and further intervened with CJAF. A total of 232 active compounds of CJAF were obtained, a total of 397 potential targets for the active ingredients were retrieved and a total of 219 common targets were obtained as the potential targets of CJAF against IBS-D. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that multiple targets were enriched and could be experimentally validated in a mouse model of IBS-D. The mechanisms were mainly converged on the immune and inflammatory pathways, especially the NF-κB, TNF and IL-17 signaling pathway, which were closely involved in the treatment of CJAF against IBS-D. Animal experiment showed that CJAF alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and diarrhea symptom of IBS-D. CJAF also restored the histological and ultrastructure damage of IBS-D. The result of western blot showed that CJAF upregulated colonic tight junction proteins of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1. Further results demonstrated that CJAF inhibited the protein expression of NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway targets and downregulated proinflammatory mediators of IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α. In conclusion, CJAF could effectively reduce inflammatory response and alleviate visceral hypersensitivity as well as diarrhea symptom of IBS-D by inhibiting the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway. This study not only reveals the mechanism of CJAF against IBS-D, but also provides a novel therapeutic strategy for IBS-D. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Obesity and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are two major public health issues. Interestingly previous data report a marked increase of IBS prevalence in morbid obese subjects compared with non-obese subjects but underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Obesity and IBS share common intestinal pathophysiological mechanisms such as gut dysbiosis, intestinal hyperpermeability and low-grade inflammatory response. We thus aimed to evaluate the link between obesity and IBS using different animal models. Male C57Bl/6 mice received high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and were then submitted to water avoidance stress (WAS). In response to WAS, HFD mice exhibited higher intestinal permeability and plasma corticosterone concentration than non-obese mice. We were not able to reproduce a similar response both in ob/ob mice and in leptin-treated non-obese mice. In addition, metformin, a hypoglycemic agent, limited fasting glycaemia both in unstressed and WAS diet-induced obese mice but only partially restored colonic permeability in unstressed HFD mice. Metformin failed to improve intestinal permeability in WAS HFD mice. Finally, cecal microbiota transplantation from HFD mice in antibiotics-treated recipient mice did not reproduce the effects observed in stressed HFD mice. In conclusion, stress induced a more marked intestinal barrier dysfunction in diet-induced obese mice compared with non-obese mice that seems to be independent of leptin, glycaemia and gut microbiota. These data should be further confirmed and the role of the dietary composition should be studied. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Chang-Kang-Fang formula (CKF), a multi-herb traditional Chinese medicinal formula, has been clinically used for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). Though we have reported the compounds of CKF and their therapeutic effect on IBS-D rats, the exact underlying mechanism is still not clear. The aim of this study was to clearly define the effect of CKF on IBS-D by regulating gut microbiota and promoting intestinal barrier. IBS-D rats were established by psychosocial stress (restraint) combined with the peripheral stimulation (senna leaf gavage) stress. The changes of body weight and the number of fecal pellets were investigated during the experiment. The effect on intestinal sensitivity was assessed based on the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores and the intestinal permeability, the expression of zona occludens 1 (ZO-1), measured by immunohistochemistry. The composition of gut microbiota was detected through 16S rRNA. The administration of CKF significantly had therapeutic effects on IBS-D rats based on the decreased AWR scores and the increased number of pellets. However, the changes of body weight were not observed. In addition, CKF could up-regulate the expression of ZO-1 in the colon and rebalance the gut microbiota of IBS-D by increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus, Allobaculum, Roseburia, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136. CKF potentially alleviated IBS-D through regulating gut microbiota and improving the intestinal barrier function. © 2022 Science Society of Thailand under Royal Patronage. All rights reserved.

AB  - The role of low-grade inflammation in the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) has attracted increasing attention. Abnormal CD11c+ mononuclear phagocytes, such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and monocytes, are involved in the disruption of immune tolerance in organisms, which can lead to the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. The present study tested the hypothesis that CD11c+ lamina propria mononuclear phagocytes (CD11c+ LPMPs) contribute to increased mucosal permeability and visceral hypersensitivity in a PI-IBS mouse model. CD11c+ LPMPs were isolated and purified via the digestion of intestinal tissues and magnetic-activated cell sorting. We detected increased mucosal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal inflammation during both the acute and chronic stages of Trichinella infection. Following the transfer of CD11c+ LPMPs from PI-IBS mice into normal mice, low-grade inflammation was detected, as demonstrated by increased IL-4 expression in the ileum, as well as enhanced mucosal permeability, as indicated by decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and the presence of ultrastructural alterations. More importantly, the mice that underwent adoptive transfer of CD11c+ LPMPs from the PI-IBS mice also exhibited increased abdominal withdrawal reflex scores and a decreased threshold. Our data demonstrated that the CD11c+ LPMPs from this PI-IBS mouse model were not only able to transfer enteric inflammation to the normal mice but also caused abnormal intestinal function, characterized by epithelial barrier disruption and visceral hyperalgesia.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic intestinal disorder accompanied by low-grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Several studies have indicated that Lactobacillus supplementation can help to alleviate IBS symptoms and that these effects are strain-specific. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the key physiological characteristics and functional genes contributing to the IBS-alleviating effects of Lactobacillus. An IBS model was established by subjecting C57BL/6 mice to Citrobacter rodentium ingestion and water avoidance stress. Lactobacillus strains with different physiological characteristics were administered to mice intragastrically for 4 weeks (5 × 109 CFU/0.2 mL per mouse per day). Indicators of colonic inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, and gut microbiota were also evaluated. Finally, differences in functional genes between Lactobacillus strains were analyzed by a comparative genomic analysis, and the relationships between the physiological characteristics, functional genes, and IBS-alleviating effects of the strains were quantified using correlation analysis. Among the eight tested Lactobacillus strains, only Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610 significantly inhibited the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, PAR-2, and mast cell tryptase. L. plantarum CCFM8610 also significantly increased the intestinal barrier function, inhibited visceral hypersensitivity symptoms, and modulated the gut microbiota diversity and composition. The correlation analysis of factors associated with the IBS-alleviating effects of Lactobacillus revealed the ability to synthesize conjugated linoleic acid as the most strongly associated physiological characteristic and COG1028-related genes as the most strongly associated functional genes. In conclusion, these findings can facilitate the rapid screening of Lactobacillus strains with IBS-alleviating effects and lay a foundation for studies of the related mechanisms. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Grape seed extract (GSE) is rich in polyphenols composed mainly of proanthocyanidins, which are known to attenuate proinflammatory cytokine production. Repeated water avoidance stress (WAS) induces visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and proinflammatory cytokine pathways, which is a rat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) model. Thus, we explored the effects of GSE on repeated WAS (1 h for 3 days)-induced visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability in Sprague-Dawley rats. Paracellular permeability, as evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance and flux of carboxyfluorescein, was analyzed in Caco-2 cell monolayers treated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β. WAS caused visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability, and intragastric administration of GSE (100 mg/kg, once daily for 11 days) inhibited these changes. Furthermore, GSE also suppressed the elevated colonic levels of IL-6, TLR4, and claudin-2 caused by WAS. Paracellular permeability was increased in Caco-2 cell monolayers in the presence of IL-6 and IL-1β, which was inhibited by GSE. Additionally, GSE suppressed the claudin-2 expression elevated by cytokine stimulation. The effects of GSE on visceral changes appear to be evoked by suppressing colonic TLR4-cytokine signaling and maintaining tight junction integrity. GSE may be useful for treating IBS. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI), an oral nutritional therapy, is efficacious in diverse diarrheal diseases. In an open-label study in 15 patients with irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea (IBS-D), we evaluated effects of SBI (5.0 g, twice a day) for 8 weeks on safety, on bowel function and abdominal pain, tryptophan metabolism (K:T ratio), intestinal permeability (13C-mannitol and lactulose excretion), bile acid synthesis (fasting serum FGF-19 and C4), duodenal and stool microbiome, and the expression of 90 genes related to inflammation, immune function, and tight junctions in duodenal mucosa. Statistical analysis (paired tests, baseline vs. treatment) was based on intention to treat (ITT) principles. One of 15 Caucasian patients (13F, 2M, age 40.3 ± 2.3y, BMI 34.3 ± 3.0 kg/m2) withdrew without completing studies. There were improvements in stools/day (decrease, P < 0.001), ease of passage (P = 0.035), and evacuation (P = 0.004) with SBI therapy. Worst pain severity was numerically reduced in last 2 weeks' treatment (P = 0.078). Duodenal mucosal mRNA expression; serum C4, FGF-19, and KT ratio; small bowel or colon permeability; and stool microbiome were not significantly different after SBI therapy, compared to baseline. In duodenal brushings, there was considerable microbiota structure difference (β diversity analysis P = 0.072, UniFrac) and, on taxonomic analysis, increased abundance of Proteobacteria Burkholderiales, Firmicutes Catonella, and unclassified genus organisms with SBI therapy. Thus, SBI therapy for 8 weeks in IBS-D patients is associated with improved bowel function; the mechanism of benefit is unclear, though there were microbiota structure differences in duodenal brushings. Further studies in patients with low-grade inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction at baseline are indicated. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Enteric glial cells (EGC) and mast cells (MC) are intimately associated with gastrointestinal physiological functions. We aimed to investigate EGC-MC interaction in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a gut-brain disorder linked to increased intestinal permeability, and MC. Methods: Parallel approaches were used to quantify EGC markers in colonic biopsies from healthy controls (HC) and patients with IBS. Data were correlated with MC, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and VIP receptors (VPAC1/VPAC2) expressions, and bacterial translocation through biopsies mounted in Ussing chambers. In addition, we investigated the effects of EGC mediators on colonic permeability and the pharmacological-induced responses of EGC and MC cell lines. Key Results: Immunofluorescence of IBS colonic mucosa, as well as Western blotting and ELISA of IBS biopsy lysates, revealed increased glial fibrillary intermediate filament (GFAP) expression, indicating EGC activation. Mucosal GFAP correlated with increased MC and VPAC1+MC numbers and decreased VIP+MC, which seemed to control bacterial translocation in HC. In the contrary, EGC activation in IBS correlated with less MC and VPAC1+ MC numbers, and more VIP+ MC. In vitro, MC and EGC cell lines showed intracellular calcium responses to each other's mediators. Furthermore, EGC mediators prevented VIP-induced MC degranulation, while MC mediators induced a reactive EGC phenotype. In Ussing chambers, EGC mediators decreased paracellular passage through healthy colonic biopsies. Conclusions & Inferences: Findings suggest the involvement of EGC and MC in the control of barrier function in the human colon and indicate a potential EGC-MC interaction that seems altered in IBS, with detrimental consequences to colonic permeability. Altogether, results suggest that imbalanced EGC-MC communication contributes to the pathophysiology of IBS. © 2021 The Authors. Neurogastroenterology & Motility published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is multifactorial, characterized in part by increased intestinal permeability, and visceral hypersensitivity. Increased permeability is associated with IBS severity and abdominal pain. Tenapanor is FDA-approved for the treatment of IBS with constipation (IBS-C) and has demonstrated improvements in bowel motility and a reduction in IBS-related pain; however, the mechanism by which tenapanor mediates these functions remains unclear. Here, the effects of tenapanor on colonic pain signaling and intestinal permeability were assessed through behavioral, electrophysiological, and cell culture experiments. Intestinal motility studies in rats and humans demonstrated that tenapanor increased luminal sodium and water retention and gastrointestinal transit versus placebo. A significantly reduced visceral motor reflex (VMR) to colonic distension was observed with tenapanor treatment versus vehicle in two rat models of visceral hypersensitivity (neonatal acetic acid sensitization and partial restraint stress; both P < 0.05), returning VMR responses to that of nonsensitized controls. Whole cell voltage patch-clamp recordings of retrogradely labeled colonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons from sensitized rats found that tenapanor significantly reduced DRG neuron hyperexcitability to capsaicin versus vehicle (P < 0.05), an effect not mediated by epithelial cell secretions. Tenapanor also attenuated increases in intestinal permeability in human colon monolayer cultures caused by incubation with proinflammatory cytokines (P < 0.001) or fecal supernatants from patients with IBS-C (P < 0.005). These results support a model in which tenapanor reduces IBS-related pain by strengthening the intestinal barrier, thereby decreasing permeability to macromolecules and antigens and reducing DRG-mediated pain signaling. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Intestinal permeability to probe molecules has been shown to correlate closely with the presence or absence of villous atrophy in a jejunal biopsy. The purpose of this study was to establish if there exist groups of patients with functional derangement of intestinal permeability but normal histopathology of the small bowel mucosa. In 135 patients a cellobiose/mannitol permeability test was performed at the same time as jejunal biopsy. Diagnosis included coeliac disease, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, idiopathic diarrhoea, self diagnosed food allergy, atrophic eczema and postinfectious malabsorption. The value of the cellobiose/mannitol test in identifying patients with abnormal jejunal biopsy histopathology was confirmed. The permeability test was abnormal in all 28 patients with partial or subtotal villous atrophy, and also in all 10 in whom there was a high intraepithelial lymphocyte count despite normal villi and crypts. Functional abnormality of the small intestine has not previously been reported in patients with this jejunal biopsy abnormality. Abnormalities of permeability were also found in patients with idiopathic diarrhoea, folate deficiency, postinfectious or traveller's diarrhoea, small bowel Crohn's disease, and atopic eczema. These results show that sugar permeability tests have more potential in clinical investigation that merely serving as screening tests before jejunal biopsy. There are groups of patients without morphological changes in the small bowel in whom intestinal permeability is abnormal.

AB  - Background: Biological sex plays a prominent role in the prevalence and severity of a number of important stress-related gastrointestinal and immune-related diseases including IBS and allergy/anaphylaxis. Despite the establishment of sex differences in these diseases, the underlying mechanisms contributing to sex differences remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of biological sex on mast cells (MCs), an innate immune cell central to the pathophysiology of many GI and allergic disorders. Methods: Twelve-week-old C57BL/6 male and female mice were exposed to immunological stress (2 h of IgE-mediated passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA)) or psychological stress (1 h of restraint stress (RS)) and temperature, clinical scores, serum histamine, and intestinal permeability (for RS) were measured. Primary bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) were harvested from male and female mice and analyzed for MC degranulation, signaling pathways, mediator content, and RNA transcriptome analysis. Results: Sexually dimorphic responses were observed in both models of PSA and RS and in primary MCs. Compared with male mice, female mice exhibited increased clinical scores, hypothermia, and serum histamine levels in response to PSA and had greater intestinal permeability and serum histamine responses to RS. Primary BMMCs from female mice exhibited increased release of β-hexosaminidase, histamine, tryptase, and TNF-α upon stimulation with IgE/DNP and A23187. Increased mediator release in female BMMCs was not associated with increased upstream phospho-tyrosine signaling pathways or downstream Ca2+ mobilization. Instead, increased mediator release in female MCs was associated with markedly increased capacity for synthesis and storage of MC granule-associated immune mediators as determined by MC mediator content and RNA transcriptome analysis. Conclusions: These results provide a new understanding of sexual dimorphic responses in MCs and have direct implications for stress-related diseases associated with a female predominance and MC hyperactivity including irritable bowel syndrome, allergy, and anaphylaxis. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Alterations in brain/gut/microbiota axis are linked to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) physiopathology. Upon gastrointestinal infection, chronic abdominal pain and anxio-depressive comorbidities may persist despite pathogen clearance leading to Post-Infectious IBS (PI-IBS). This study assesses the influence of tryptophan metabolism, and particularly the microbiota-induced AhR expression, on intestinal homeostasis disturbance following gastroenteritis resolution, and evaluates the efficacy of IL-22 cytokine vectorization on PI-IBS symptoms. The Citrobacter rodentium infection model in C57BL6/J mice was used to mimic Enterobacteria gastroenteritis. Intestinal homeostasis was evaluated as low-grade inflammation, permeability, mucosa-associated microbiota composition, and colonic sensitivity. Cognitive performances and emotional state of animals were assessed using several tests. Tryptophan metabolism was analyzed by targeted metabolomics. AhR activity was evaluated using a luciferase reporter assay method. One Lactococcus lactis strain carrying an eukaryotic expression plasmid for murine IL-22 (L. lactis IL−22) was used to induce IL-22 production in mouse colonic mucosa. C. rodentium-infected mice exhibited persistent colonic hypersensitivity and cognitive impairments and anxiety-like behaviors after pathogen clearance. These post-infectious disorders were associated with low-grade inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, decrease of Lactobacillaceae abundance associated with the colonic layer, and increase of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). During post-infection period, the indole pathway and AhR activity were decreased due to a reduction of tryptophol production. Treatment with L. lactis IL−22 restored gut permeability and normalized colonic sensitivity, restored cognitive performances and decreased anxiety-like behaviors. Data from the video-tracking system suggested an upgrade of welfare for mice receiving the L.lactis IL−22 strain. Our findings revealed that AhR/IL-22 signaling pathway is altered in a preclinical PI-IBS model. IL-22 delivering alleviate PI-IBS symptoms as colonic hypersensitivity, cognitive impairments, and anxiety-like behaviors by acting on intestinal mucosa integrity. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway could be developed to treat IBS patients suffering from chronic abdominal pain and associated well-being disorders. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by visceral pain, impaired intestinal barrier and a disorder of the microbiota. DXL-A-24 has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neuropeptides and inflammatory factors. In this study, we used chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced IBS model, to assess the action of DXL-A-24 on visceral hypersensitivity, barrier function and microbiota. Visceral sensation was assessed by colorectal distension in a model of IBS. The expressions of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot, the contents of diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic acid were detected by ELISA, and 16S rRNA to detect the diversity of gut microbiota. CUMS reduced visceral pain threshold and increased colonic permeability of rats. DXL-A-24 for 28 days inhibited these changes. DXL-A-24 also decreased the expression of SP, CGRP in colon and D-LA, DAO in serum. Besides, DXL-A-24 increased the richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota. In conclusions, DXL-A-24 reduced visceral sensitivity, improved intestinal barrier and regulated gut microbiota in rats with IBS. © 2023

AB  - Objective The intestinal lumen contains several proteases. Our aim was to determine the role of faecal proteases in mediating barrier dysfunction and symptoms in IBS. Design 39 patients with IBS and 25 healthy volunteers completed questionnaires, assessments of in vivo permeability, ex vivo colonic barrier function in Ussing chambers, tight junction (TJ) proteins, ultrastructural morphology and 16 s sequencing of faecal microbiota rRNA. A casein-based assay was used to measure proteolytic activity (PA) in faecal supernatants (FSNs). Colonic barrier function was determined in mice (ex-germ free) humanised with microbial communities associated with different human PA states. Results Patients with IBS had higher faecal PA than healthy volunteers. 8/20 postinfection IBS (PI-IBS) and 3/19 constipation- predominant IBS had high PA (>95th percentile). High-PA patients had more and looser bowel movements, greater symptom severity and higher in vivo and ex vivo colonic permeability. High-PA FSNs increased paracellular permeability, decreased occludin and increased phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) expression. Serine but not cysteine protease inhibitor significantly blocked high-PA FSN effects on barrier. The effects on barrier were diminished by pharmacological or siRNA inhibition of protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2). Patients with high-PA IBS had lower occludin expression, wider TJs on biopsies and reduced microbial diversity than patients with low PA. Mice humanised with high-PA IBS microbiota had greater in vivo permeability than those with low-PA microbiota. Conclusion A subset of patients with IBS, especially in PI-IBS, has substantially high faecal PA, greater symptoms, impaired barrier and reduced microbial diversity. Commensal microbiota affects luminal PA that can influence host barrier function. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.

AB  - To investigate the beneficial effects of oridonin, a diterpenoid compound isolated from Rabdosia rubescens, on the inflammatory response in TNBS-induced post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) model and the underlying mechanism. Using the PI-IBS rat model and Caco-2 cell lines, we found that intestinal barrier function reflected by lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio and tight junction protein level was significantly ameliorated by oridonin. We also demonstrated that oridonin abrogated inflammation through inhibiting the phosphorylation of NF-κBp65 as well as its downstream gene (iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, and IL-6) level. Molecular docking studies confirmed the good binding activity between oridonin and PXR. In Caco-2 cell lines, oridonin markedly inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation in a PXR-dependent manner. Meanwhile, PXR and its target genes CYP3A4 and P-gp were induced by oridonin, which was associated with the decreased expression of NF-κB and the recovery of intestinal barrier. This study indicated that the therapeutic effect of oridonin on experimental PI-IBS through repairing intestinal barrier function may be closely associated with the regulatory role of PXR/NF-κB signaling pathway. Oridonin may serve as a PXR ligand for the development of drugs in the therapy for PI-IBS. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Animal studies have shown that intestinal barrier function is compromised with aging. We aimed to assess the effects of aging on intestinal barrier function in humans in vivo and ex vivo. In this cross-sectional study, healthy subjects and subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) of older (65–75 years) and young adult age (18–40 years) were compared. In vivo gastrointestinal site-specific permeability was assessed by a multi-sugar test, taking into account potential confounders. Sigmoid biopsies were collected from subgroups of healthy young adults and elderly for ex vivo Ussing chamber experiments, gene transcription of barrier-related genes and staining of junctional proteins. No significant differences between healthy young adults and elderly were found for small intestinal, colonic and whole gut permeability (P ≥ 0.142). In IBS patients, gastroduodenal and colonic permeability did not differ significantly (P ≥ 0.400), but small intestinal and whole gut permeability were higher in elderly versus young adults (P ≤ 0.009), mainly driven by the IBS-diarrhea subtype. Ussing chamber experiments with or without stressor (P ≥ 0.052), and relative expression of intestinal barrier-related genes (P ≥ 0.264) showed no significant differences between healthy elderly and young adults, as confirmed by immunofluorescent stainings. Overall, the functional capacity of the intestinal barrier is maintained in elderly. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Increasing evidence suggests the beneficial effects of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but little is known about how they can impact the gut microbiota. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of a multistrain probiotic on IBS symptoms, gut permeability and gut microbiota in patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Methods: Adults with IBS-D were enrolled in an open-label trial to receive a multistrain probiotic for 4 weeks. Abdominal pain, stool frequency, quality of life, gut permeability, and the luminal and adherent microbiota from colonic biopsies were evaluated before and after supplementation. Results: Probiotics significantly improved symptoms and quality of life, despite having no impact on permeability in the global population. In the population stratified by the response, the diarrhoea responders displayed reduced colonic permeability after supplementation. The luminal and adherent microbiota were specifically altered depending on the patients’ clinical responses regarding pain and diarrhoea. Interestingly, we identified a microbial signature in IBS-D patients that could predict a response or lack of response to supplementation. Conclusions: The multistrain probiotic improved the symptoms of IBS-D patients and induced distinct effects on the gut microbiota according to the patient’s clinical response and initial microbiota composition. Our study further supports the need to develop individualised probiotic-based approaches regarding IBS. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Oral monosaccharides and disaccharides are used to measure in vivo human gut permeability through urinary excretion. Aims: The aims were as follows: (1) to obtain normative data on small intestinal and colonic permeability; (2) to assess variance on standard 16 g fiber diet performed twice; (3) to determine whether dietary fiber influences gut permeability measurements; and (4) to present pilot data using 2 selected probes in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Methods: Sixty healthy female and male adults, age 18–70 years, participated in 3 randomized studies (2 studies on 16.25 g and 1 study on 32.5 g fiber) in otherwise standardized diets. At each test, the following sugars were ingested: 12C-mannitol, 13C-mannitol, rhamnose (monosaccharides), sucralose, and lactulose (disaccharides). Standardized meals were administered from 24 hours before and during 24 hours post-sugars with 3 urine collections: 0–2, 2–8, and 8–24 hours. Sugars were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Eighteen patients with IBS-D underwent 24-hour excretion studies after oral 13C-mannitol and lactulose. Results: Baseline sugars (>3-fold above lower limits of quantitation) were identified in the 3 studies: 12C-mannitol in all participants; sucralose in 4–8, and rhamnose in 1–3. Median excretions/24 h (percentage of administered dose) for 13C-mannitol, rhamnose, lactulose, and sucralose were ∼30%, ∼15%, 0.32%, and 2.3%, respectively. 13C-mannitol and rhamnose reflected mainly small intestinal permeability. Intraindividual saccharide excretions were consistent, with minor differences with 16.25 g vs 32.5 g fiber diets. Median interindividual coefficient of variation was 76.5% (10–90 percentile: 34.6–111.0). There were no significant effects of sex, age, or body mass index on permeability measurements in health. 13C-mannitol measurements are feasible in IBS-D. Conclusions: Baseline 12C-mannitol excretion precludes its use; 13C-mannitol is the preferred probe for small intestinal permeability. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Background. Maren pills have been used to treat constipation. Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) plays a vital role in regulating water transfer in the colon. It has been reported that the downregulation of AQP3 can regulate liquid water metabolism and intestinal permeability in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rats' colon via NF-κB pathway. In this study, we investigated whether the laxative effect of Maren pills is associated with the regulation of AQP3 and NF-κB signaling pathway in the colon. Methods. The compound diphenoxylate suspension-induced STC rats received Maren pills intragastrically for 1 consecutive week to evaluate the laxative effect of Maren pills involving the regulation of AQP3 and NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) were treated with drug serum to obtain in vitro data. Results. Our results revealed that treatment with Maren pills increased the stool number, moisture content of feces, and intestinal transit rate in a dose-dependent manner. Maren pills significantly increased the AQP3, fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and protein kinase A (PKA) proteins in the colon of rats and in HT-29 cells. Mechanistically, Maren pills obviously inhibited the activation of NF-κB pathway in the colon of rats and in HT-29 cells. Conclusion. These results suggest that the laxative effect of Maren pills is associated with the increased expression of AQP3 by downregulating NF-κB signal pathway. © 2020 Yu Zhan et al.

AB  - Background & Aims: Increased gut permeability might contribute to the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome or functional abdominal pain (IBS or FAP). We investigated whether siblings and parents of children with IBS or FAP have increased gut permeability. Methods: We performed permeability tests (using sucrose, lactulose, mannitol, and sucralose) on 29 siblings and 43 parents of children with IBS or FAP, and 43 children (controls) and 42 parents of controls, from primary and secondary care. Permeability studies were repeated in 7 siblings and 37 parents of children with IBS or FAP and 23 controls and 36 parents of controls following ingestion of 400 mg of ibuprofen. Percent recovery of sucrose was calculated based on analyses of urine collected overnight; the lactulose/mannitol ratio and percent recovery of sucralose were based on analyses of urine samples collected over a 24-hour period. Results: When we controlled for age, sex, and family membership, siblings of children with IBS or FAP had increased small bowel permeability (urinary lactulose/mannitol ratio) vs controls (P =.004). There was no difference in gastroduodenal (percent sucrose recovery) or colonic (percent sucralose recovery) permeability between groups. Similarly, parents of children with IBS or FAP also had increased small bowel permeability, compared with parents of controls (P =.015), with no differences in gastric or colonic permeability. After administration of ibuprofen, gastroduodenal and small bowel permeability tended to be greater in IBS or FAP siblings (P =.08) and gastroduodenal permeability tended to be greater in IBS or FAP parents (P =.086). Conclusions: Siblings and parents of children with IBS or FAP have increased baseline small intestinal permeability compared with control children and their parents. These results indicate that there are familial influences on gastrointestinal permeability in patients with IBS or FAP. © 2020 AGA Institute

AB  - Oral administration of probiotics has been proposed as a promising biotherapy to prevent and treat different diseases related to gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Due to the increasing research area on the characterisation of new probiotic bacterial strains, it is necessary to perform suitable in vitro experiments, using pertinent cellular models, in order to establish appropriate readout profiles based on IBS symptoms and subtypes. In this work, a collection of 30 candidate strains, belonging mainly to the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, were screened using three different sets of in vitro experiments with different readouts to identify promising probiotic strains with: (1) the ability to inhibit the synthesis of IL-8 production by TNF-α stimulated HT-29 cells, (2) immunomodulatory properties quantified as increased IL-10 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs), and (3) the ability to maintain epithelial barrier integrity by increasing the trans-epithelial/endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values in Caco-2 cells. Based on these criteria, three strains were selected: Lactobacillus gasseri PI41, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus PI48 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis PI50, and tested in a murine model of low-grade inflammation induced by dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS), which mimics some of the symptoms of IBS. Among the three strains, L. gasseri PI41 improved overall host well-being by preventing body weight loss in DNBS-treated mice and restored gut homeostasis by normalising the intestinal permeability and reducing pro-inflammatory markers. Therefore, the potential of this strain was confirmed in a second murine model known to reproduce IBS symptoms: the neonatal maternal separation (NMS) model. The PI41 strain was effective in preventing intestinal permeability and reducing colonic hypersensitivity. In conclusion, the set of in vitro experiments combined with in vivo assessments allowed us to identify a promising probiotic candidate strain, L. gasseri PI41, in the context of IBS.

AB  - Background: An altered intestinal mucosal barrier has been demonstrated in subsets of patients with IBS and FAP and may be an additional biological factor contributing to symptom generation in children with FD. The objective of this study was to determine if intestinal permeability is increased in children/adolescents with functional dyspepsia (FD) and whether intestinal permeability is correlated with mucosal inflammation and/or symptoms of anxiety or depression in this population. Methods. A sugar absorption test was performed in 19 patients with FD and 19 controls. Anxiety and depression were assessed in both groups utilizing a standard questionnaire. In FD patients, duodenal mean and peak mast cell and eosinophil densities were determined. Results: Intestinal permeability as measured by the sugar absorption test did not differ between children with FD and controls. In children with FD, there was no correlation between permeability and mast cell density, eosinophil density, anxiety scores, or depression scores, respectively. Conclusions: Pediatric FD does not appear to be associated with increased small bowel intestinal permeability, however, there are some limitations to the current study. Trial registration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) relieves symptoms in children with recurrent abdominal pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 141 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional pain were enrolled in 9 primary care sites and a referral center. Children entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and received LGG or placebo for 8 weeks and entered follow-up for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was overall pain at the end of the intervention period. At entry and at the end of the trial, children underwent a double-sugar intestinal permeability test. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, LGG, but not placebo, caused a significant reduction of both frequency (P < .01) and severity (P < .01) of abdominal pain. These differences still were significant at the end of follow-up (P < .02 and P < .001, respectively). At week 12, treatment success was achieved in 48 children in the LGG group compared with 37 children in the placebo group (P < .03); this difference still was present at the end of follow-up (P < .03). At entry, 59% of the children had abnormal results from the intestinal permeability test; LGG, but not placebo, determined a significant decrease in the number of patients with abnormal results from the intestinal permeability testing (P < .03). These effects mainly were in children with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: LGG significantly reduces the frequency and severity of abdominal pain in children with IBS; this effect is sustained and may be secondary to improvement of the gut barrier.

AB  - Background: Impaired intestinal permeability and microbial dysbiosis are important pathophysiological mechanisms underlying irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). ReFerm®, also called Profermin®, is a postbiotic product of oat gruel fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v. In this study, we investigated whether ReFerm® has a beneficial effect on the intestinal epithelial barrier function in patients with IBS. Materials and methods: Thirty patients with moderate to severe IBS-diarrhoea (IBS-D) or IBS-mixed (IBS-M) were treated with enema containing ReFerm® or placebo. The patients underwent sigmoidoscopy with biopsies obtained from the distal colon at baseline and after 14 days of treatment with ReFerm® or placebo twice daily. The biopsies were mounted in Ussing chambers, and paracellular and transcellular permeabilities were measured for 120 min. In addition, the effects of ReFerm® or placebo on the epithelial barrier were investigated in vitro using Caco-2 cells. Results: ReFerm® reduced paracellular permeability (p < 0.05) and increased transepithelial resistance (TER) over time (p < 0.01), whereas the placebo had no significant effect in patients. In ReFerm®-treated Caco-2 cells, paracellular and transcellular permeabilities were decreased compared to the control (p < 0.05) and placebo (p < 0.01). TER was increased in Caco-2 ReFerm®-treated cells, and normalised TER was increased in ReFerm®-treated Caco-2 cells compared to control (p < 0.05) and placebo-treated (p < 0.05) cells. Conclusion: ReFerm® significantly reduced paracellular permeability and improved TER in colonic biopsies collected from patients with IBS and in a Caco-2 cell model. Our results offer new insights into the potential benefits of ReFerm® in IBS management. Further studies are needed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the barrier-protective properties of ReFerm®.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder whose pathogenesis is considered multifactorial, including abnormal gut motility, visceral hyperreactivity, psychological factors, disturbances in the brain-gut axis, leaky gut, oxidative stress, etc. We aimed to investigate serum levels of specific immunoglobulin E and G to common food antigens and zonulin and to assess their use in clinical practice for patients with IBS. Material and methods. We included 23 participants, 15 with IBS (diagnosed according to the Rome IV criteria) and 8 healthy controls. We investigated serum levels of specific IgG antibodies to 24 food antigens, specific IgE antibodies to 20 food antigens, anti-celiac antibodies, fecal calprotectin and serum zonulin by ELISA. Results. Food-specific positive IgG antibodies were significantly higher in patients with IBS than in controls (p = 0.007). IgE-mediated allergic reactions were found in five patients with IBS; no one had anti-TG antibodies. One-third of IBS patients demonstrated a low degree of chronic inflammation (positive fecal calprotectin test > 50 ng/mL) without specific bacterial infection. Serum levels of zonulin in IBS patients were higher than in healthy controls (0.378 ± 0.13 vs. 0.250 ± 0.14 ng/mL, p = 0.0315). However, no correlations between clinical symptoms and zonulin levels were found. Conclusion. The mechanisms of IgG hypersensitivity and low degree inflammation in IBS and elevated zonulin may contribute to multifactor pathogenesis in IBS. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is a bacterial human pathogen causing gastroenteritis and sequelae like irritable bowel syndrome. Epidemiologists count the human campylobacteriosis by C. jejuni as the most common foodborne zoonosis and bacterial diarrheal disease worldwide. Based on bioinformatics predictions for potential protective compounds in campylobacteriosis, the question was raised whether the plant-based polyphenol resveratrol is sufficient to attenuate intestinal epithelial damage induced by C. jejuni. We investigated this by performing experimental infection studies in an epithelial cell culture and the secondary abiotic IL-10−/− mouse model. In C. jejuni-infected human colonic HT-29/B6 cell monolayers, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was decreased and the paracellular marker flux of fluorescein (332 Da) increased. Concomitantly, the tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin and claudin-5 were re-distributed off the tight junction domain. This was accompanied by an increased induction of epithelial apoptosis, both changes contributing to compromised barrier function and the opening of the leak pathway induced by C. jejuni. In parallel, the recovery experiments with the application of resveratrol revealed a functional improvement of the disturbed epithelial barrier in both models in vitro and in vivo. During treatment with resveratrol, TJ localization of occludin and claudin-5 was fully restored in the paracellular domain of HT-29/B6 cells. Moreover, resveratrol decreased the rate of epithelial apoptosis. These resveratrol-induced molecular and cellular effects would therefore be expected to improve epithelial barrier function, thereby minimizing the so-called leaky gut phenomenon. In conclusion, the induction of the leak pathway by C. jejuni and the restoration of barrier function by resveratrol demonstrates its effectiveness as a potential preventive or therapeutic method of mitigating the leaky gut associated with campylobacteriosis. © Copyright © 2021 Lobo de Sá, Heimesaat, Bereswill, Nattramilarasu, Schulzke and Bücker.

AB  - Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), associated with increased intestinal permeability, inflammation, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, can be triggered by acute gastroenteritis. Cytolethal distending toxin B (CdtB) is produced by gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and may underlie IBS-D development, through molecular mimicry with vinculin. Here, we examine the effects of exposure to CdtB alone on gut microbiome composition, host intestinal gene expression, and IBS-D-like phenotypes in a rat model. CdtB-inoculated rats exhibited increased anti-CdtB levels, which correlated with increased stool wet weights, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL2) and predicted microbial metabolic pathways including inflammatory responses, TNF responses, and diarrhea. Three distinct ileal microbiome profiles (microtypes) were identified in CdtB-inoculated rats. The first microtype (most like controls) had altered relative abundance (RA) of genera Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, and Rothia. The second had lower microbial diversity, higher Escherichia-Shigella RA, higher absolute E. coli abundance, and altered host ileal tissue expression of immune-response and TNF-response genes compared to controls. The third microtype had higher microbial diversity, higher RA of hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producer Desulfovibrio, and increased expression of H2S-associated pain/serotonin response genes. All CdtB-inoculated rats exhibited decreased ileal expression of cell junction component mRNAs, including vinculin-associated proteins. Significantly, cluster-specific microRNA-mRNA interactions controlling intestinal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity/pain, and gastrointestinal motility genes, including several previously associated with IBS were seen. These findings demonstrate that exposure to CdtB toxin alone results in IBS-like phenotypes including inflammation and diarrhea-like stool, decreased expression of intestinal barrier components, and altered ileal microtypes that influenced changes in microRNA-modulated gene expression and predicted metabolic pathways consistent with specific IBS-D symptoms. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is the most prevalent cause of foodborne bacterial enteritis worldwide. Patients present with diarrhea and immune responses lead to complications like arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. Although studies exist in animal and cell models, we aimed at a functional and structural characterization of intestinal dysfunction and the involved regulatory mechanisms in human colon. First, in patients' colonic biopsies, sodium malabsorption was identified as an important diarrheal mechanism resulting from hampered epithelial ion transport via impaired epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) β- and γ-subunit. In addition, barrier dysfunction from disrupted epithelial tight junction proteins (claudin-1, -3, -4, -5, and -8), epithelial apoptosis, and appearance of lesions was detected, which cause leak-flux diarrhea and can perpetuate immune responses. Importantly, these effects in human biopsies either represent direct action of Campylobacter jejuni (ENaC impairment) or are caused by proinflammatory signaling (barrier dysfunction). This was revealed by regulator analysis from RNA-sequencing (cytometric bead array-checked) and confirmed in cell models, which identified interferon-γ, TNFα, IL-13, and IL-1β. Finally, bioinformatics' predictions yielded additional information on protective influences like vitamin D, which was confirmed in cell models. Thus, these are candidates for intervention strategies against C. jejuni infection and post-infectious sequelae, which result from the permissive barrier defect along the leaky gut. © 2018 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - Background: Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction is involved in the development and pathogenesis of intestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease. This study was performed to evaluate the ability of total flavonoid extract from hawthorn (TFH) to improve TNF-a-evoked intestinal epithelial barrier deficit. Material/Methods: Caco-2 cells monolayers were exposed to TNF-a in different concentrations of TFH. Intestinal epithelial barrier function was evaluated using epithelial permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Results: Our findings showed that TFH alleviated the increase of paracellular permeability and the decline of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) evoked by TNF-a. Additionally, 24-h pre-incubation with TFH inhibited TNF-a-evoked secretion of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and IL-1b). Furthermore, TFH inhibited TNF-a-evoked overexpression of pMLC and MLCK and alleviated breakdown of TJs protein (ZO-1 and occludin). The activations of Elk-1 and NFkBp65 were inhibited by TFH pre-incubation. Conclusions: TFH can alleviate TNF-a-evoked intestinal epithelial barrier deficit via the NFkBp65-mediated MLCK-MLC signaling pathway. © Med Sci Monit.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to investigate the role of Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) H19 in the pathogenesis of Diarrhea Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D), and further to the regulatory effect of LncRNA H19 on AQP1, 3 in the intestinal mucosa of IBS-D patients, so as to seek a new way to elucidate the mechanism of IBS in clinic. Methods: The levels of LncRNA H19, AQP1, and AQP3 were detected in colonic tissues of IBS-D patients, compared with that in healthy controls. Through RNA gene interference and activation methods, small activating RNA (saRNA) and small interfering (siRNA) were transfered into Caco-2 cells in vitro experiment, and sub-group for two control group, siH19 empty vector group, siH19 interference group, overexpression H19 vector group, and overexpression H19 empty vector group. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were applied to evaluate the expression levels of LncRNA H19 and the amount of AQP1 and AQP3 protein expression, respectively. Results: Compared with healthy volunteers, the levels of LncRNA H19, AQP1, and AQP3 in the colonic mucosa of IBS-D patients were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The results in vitro transfection experiment revealed that the level of LncRNA H19 in the siH19 interference group was significantly declined (P < 0.05), while there was a remarkable increase in the overexpression H19 vector group (P < 0.05), compared with the corresponding control groups. The expression of AQP1 and AQP3 in Caco-2 cells was of positive correlation with the level of LncRNA H19. Conclusion: That the down-regulation of LncRNA H19 resulted in the expression changes of AQP1 and AQP3 may play an important role in the occurrence and development of IBS-D. © Copyright © 2021 Chao, Wang, Yang and Zhang.

AB  - Background: Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is one of the most common causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. One sequela of this infection is the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). It has been suggested that a dysfunctional intestinal barrier may promote IBS development. We aimed to test this hypothesis against the background of the leaky gut concept for low-grade inflammation in PI-IBS. Methods: We identified patients with persistent PI-IBS symptoms after C. jejuni infection. During sigmoidoscopy, forceps biopsies were obtained for electrophysiological measurements of epithelial transport and barrier function in miniaturized Ussing devices. C. jejuni absence was checked by PCR and cytokine production with immunohistochemistry. Results: In PI-IBS, the epithelial resistance of the colon epithelium was unaltered, reflecting an intact paracellular pathway. In contrast, temperature-dependent horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 44 kDa) permeation increased. Short-circuit current (Isc) reflecting active anion secretion and ENaC-dependent electrogenic sodium absorption was unaffected. Early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) and IL-4 levels increased. C. jejuni is not incorporated into the resident microbiota of the colon mucosa in PI-IBS. Conclusions: In PI-IBS after C. jejuni infection, macromolecule uptake via endocytosis was enhanced, leading to low-grade inflammation with pro-inflammatory cytokine release. The findings will allow C. jejuni-induced pathomechanisms to be targeted during infection and, thereafter to reduce sequelae such as PI-IBS. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Antibiotics disrupt normal gut microbiota and cause dysbiosis, leading to a reduction in intestinal epithelial barrier function. Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, which is known as “leaky gut”, results in increased intestinal permeability and contributes to the development or exacerbation of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. We have previously reported on a murine model of intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction associated with dysbiosis induced by the administration of ampicillin and vancomycin. Saireito, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, is often used to treat autoimmune disorders including ulcerative colitis; the possible mechanism of action and its efficacy, however, remains unclear. In this study, we examined the efficacy of Saireito in our animal model for leaky gut associated with dysbiosis. C57BL/6 mice were fed a Saireito diet for the entirety of the protocol (day1-28). To induce colitis, ampicillin and vancomycin were administered in drinking water for the last seven consecutive days (day22-28). As previously demonstrated, treatment with antibiotics caused fecal occult bleeding, cecum enlargement with black discoloration, colon inflammation with epithelial cell apoptosis, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Oral administration of Saireito significantly improved antibiotics-induced fecal occult bleeding and cecum enlargement by suppressing inflammation in the colon. Furthermore, Saireito treatment ensured the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier by suppressing apoptosis and inducing cell adhesion proteins including ZO-1, occludin, and E-cadherin in intestinal epithelial cells, which in turn decreased intestinal epithelial permeability. Moreover, the reduced microbial diversity seen in the gut of mice treated with antibiotics was remarkably improved with the administration of Saireito. In addition, Saireito altered the composition of gut microbiota in these mice. These results suggest that Saireito alleviates leaky gut caused by antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Our findings provide a potentially new therapeutic strategy for antibiotic-related gastrointestinal disorders. Copyright: © 2022 Ozaka et al.

AB  - Purpose: Markers for gut integrity and inflammation have received increasing interest as intestinal permeability and innate immune system activation are suggested as possible pathophysiological mechanisms in non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). We aimed to assess relevant biomarkers in NCGS by analyzing serum levels of gut integrity and permeability markers, pro-inflammatory cytokines and antigliadin IgG in patients with suspected NCGS on a gluten-free diet (GFD), and compare them to serum levels in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and healthy controls (HC). Patients and Methods: Serum samples collected from patients with suspected NCGS on a GFD (n=20, 14 women, 21–62 years), IBS (n=20, 16 women, 24–67 years) and HC (n=20, 14 women, 21–54 years) were analyzed. IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) was applied to evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: The IBS-SSS score was higher in subjects with suspected NCGS and IBS patients compared to HC (p<0.0001). No significant differences were found in the serum levels of any of the gut integrity and permeability markers, cytokines or antigliadin IgG antibodies between the three groups. However, positive correlations were observed between claudin-1 and i-FABP, and between claudin-1 and antigliadin IgG antibodies. Conclusion: No differences in serum levels of gut integrity and permeability markers, proinflammatory cytokines or antigliadin IgG antibodies were found among patients with suspected NCGS on a GFD, IBS and HC. © 2021 Dale et al.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder, which still lacks effective therapy. We aimed to investigate the effects of a novel formulation of Bifidobacterium longum BB536 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 with vitamin B6 (LBB) on symptoms, intestinal permeability, cultivable bacteria and metabolome in IBS subjects. Materials and methods: Twenty-five IBS patients (Rome IV criteria) (M:F = 8:17; age 48 years ± 11 SD) were randomized to treatment (LBB) or placebo (one month each) in a crossover randomized double-blind controlled trial. Symptoms, intestinal habits, disease severity, intestinal permeability and intestinal microbiota were analysed at 0, 30, 45 and 60 days. Results: Percentage decrease from baseline of abdominal pain (−48.8% vs −3.5%), bloating (−36.35% vs +7.35%) and severity of disease (−30.1% vs −0.4%) was significantly (P <.0001) greater with LBB than placebo, respectively. In IBS-D patients, the improvement from baseline of Bristol score was more consistent with LBB (from 6 ± 0.4 to 4.3 ± 1.1, P <.00001) than placebo (from 6.2 ± 0.7 to 5.3 ± 1.1, P =.04). In IBS-C patients, Bristol score tended to improve from baseline after LBB (2.6 ± 1.1 vs 3.2 ± 0.5, P =.06). LBB significantly improved the percentage of sucralose recovery (colonic permeability) (1.86 ± 0.1 vs 1.1 ± 0.2, P =.01). During treatment, presumptive lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, relative abundance of propanoic, butanoic, pentanoic acids and hydrocarbons increased, while phenol decreased. Conclusions: The novel formulation of B. longum BB536 and L. rhamnosus HN001 with B6 vitamin improves symptoms and severity of disease, restores intestinal permeability and gut microbiota in IBS patients. © 2020 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation

AB  - Background: Disruptions of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) are frequently observed in various digestive diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study assessed the improvement in the IEB during the laxative activity of phlorotannin (Pt) harvested from Ecklonia cava in constipation by examining the changes in the expression of the regulatory proteins for the tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ), and inflammatory cytokines in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with loperamide (Lm)-induced constipation after a Pt treatment. Results: The Pt treatment induced laxative activity, including the improvement of feces-related parameters, gastrointestinal transit rate, and histological structure of the mid colon in Lm-treated SD rats. In addition, significant recovery effects were detected in the histology of IEB, including the mucus layer, epithelial cells, and lamina propria in the mid colon of Lm + Pt treated SD rats. The expression levels of E-cadherin and p120-catenin for AJ and the ZO-1, occludin, and Claudin-1 genes for TJ in epithelial cells were improved remarkably after the Pt treatment, but the rate of increase was different. Furthermore, the Pt treatment increased the expression level of several inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-13, and IL-4 in Lm + Pt treated SD rats. Conclusions: These results provide the first evidence that the laxative activity of Pt in SD rats with Lm-induced constipation phenotypes involve improvements in the IEB. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), once thought to be a psychosomatic disease, is being considered to be more organic. Post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS), defined as acute onset IBS (by Rome criteria) after gastrointestinal infection in an individual without prior IBS with two or more of the followings: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, a positive stool culture. The recent and old literature of PI-IBS will be reviewed. Future directions for research will be presented. Methods: Literature on PI-IBS was reviewed by electronic search and cross references of these papers. Results: Interest in studies on PI-IBS, which was described five to six decades ago, re-surfaced recently. 3.6 to 32% patients with acute gastroenteritis develop PI-IBS during 3-12 month follow-up. PI-IBS is commonly diarrhea predominant. Factors implicated in development include nature of pathogens, duration and severity of diarrhea, younger age, female gender and psychological co-morbidities like anxiety and depression. The pathogenesis of PI-IBS is largely related to continuing gut inflammation due to inability of the host to contain the inflammatory reaction, altered gut microbiota, increased intestinal permeability, muscle hyper-contractility and visceral hypersensitivity. There could be an overlap between PI-IBS and post-infectious malabsorption syndrome (PI-MAS), popularly known as tropical sprue. Conclusions: Development of IBS in a subset of patients with acute gastroenteritis is uncontested. This is expected to open a paradigm shift in understanding the pathogenesis of IBS. Future studies should address the issue of overlap of PI-IBS and PI-MAS. Exploring the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of PI-IBS may help to design preventive and therapeutic strategies. © 2011 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) undergoing biologic therapy, biomarkers of treatment response are still scarce. This study aimed to evaluate whether serum zonulin, a biomarker of intestinal permeability; soluble CD163 (sCD163), a macrophage activation marker; and a panel of serum cytokines could predict the response to biologic treatment in patients with IBD. For this purpose, we prospectively enrolled 101 patients with IBD and 19 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as a control group; 60 out of 101 patients underwent treatment with biologics. Zonulin, sCD163, and cytokines were measured at the baseline in all patients and after 10 weeks of treatment in the 60 patients who underwent biologic therapy. We observed that zonulin levels were higher in IBD patients with active disease compared to those in remission (p = 0.035), and that sCD163 values were higher in patients with IBD compared to those with IBS (p = 0.042), but no association with therapy response was observed for either biomarker. Conversely, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha showed a significant reduction from baseline to week 10 of treatment, particularly in responder patients. By multivariate logistic regression analysis corrected for disease (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis), type of biologic drug (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Vedolizumab, or Ustekinumab) and disease activity, the reduction in IL-6 values was associated with a clinical response at 12 months of biological therapy (odds ratio (OR) = 4.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25–18.02, p = 0.022). In conclusion, the measurement of serum IL-6 in biologics-treated IBD patients may allow for the prediction of response to treatment at 12 months of therapy and thus may help with tailoring personalized treatment strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is a common disorder wherein symptoms of IBS begin after an episode of acute gastroenteritis. Published studies have reported incidence of PI-IBS to range between 5% and 32%. The mechanisms underlying the development of PI-IBS are not fully understood, but are believed to include persistent sub-clinical inflammation, changes in intestinal permeability and alteration of gut flora. Individual studies have suggested that risk factors for PI-IBS include patients' demographics, psychological disorders and the severity of enteric illness. However, PI-IBS remains a diagnosis of exclusion with no specific disease markers and, to date, no definitive therapy exists. The prognosis of PI-IBS appears favorable with spontaneous and gradual resolution of symptoms in most patients. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The Chang-Kang-Fang (CKF) formula, a traditional Chinese herbal formula, can decrease serotonin (5-HT) levels and treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Probiotics have a better synergistic effect on diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) when combined with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The present study aimed to elucidate the efficacy and the mechanisms of action of the CKF formula combined with bifid triple viable capsules (PFK) against IBS-D. Methods: The rat models of IBS-D were induced by gavage with senna decoction plus restraint stress. The CKF formula, PFK and their combination were administered to the rats. Their effects were evaluated based on general condition of the rats and the AWR score. The levels of 5-HT and fos protein in the colon and hippocampus were measured by immunohistochemistry. The levels of SP and VIP, as well as ZO-1 and occludin in the colon, were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry. The intestinal microbiota in faeces was analyzed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. Results: The results showed that the oral CKF formula combined with PFK (CKF + PFK) could significantly relieve the symptoms of IBS-D, including elevating the weight rate and decreasing the AWR score. Compared with the MC group, administration of CKF + PFK significantly reduced the expression of fos in the colon and hippocampus and that of 5-HT, SP and VIP in the colon and increased the levels of 5-HT in the hippocampus and ZO-1 and occludin in the colon. The above indexes exhibited statistical significance in the CKF + PFK group relative to those in the other groups. Moreover, treatment with CKF + PFK improved the diversity of intestinal microbiota and the abundance of Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae but decreased those of Bacteroidetes and Prevotellaceae. Conclusions: The CKF formula combined with PFK may have a synergistic effect on IBS-D by slowing gastrointestinal motility, lowering visceral hypersensitivity, enhancing the intestinal barrier function and modulating the composition of intestinal microbiota.

AB  - Zonulin is considered a biomarker of increased intestinal permeability, and elevated levels have been found in celiac disease. The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between serum zonulin levels and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and secondarily, between zonulin levels and anthropometric and metabolic factors. The offspring (n = 363) of the participants of the Malmö Diet and Cancer cardiovascular cohort (MDC-CV) were invited to an anthropometric and clinical examination, where fasting plasma glucose levels were measured. Questionnaires about lifestyle factors and medical history were completed along with the Visual Analog Scale for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (VAS-IBS). Zonulin levels were measured in serum by ELISA. Neither GI symptoms nor GI diseases had any influence on zonulin levels. Higher zonulin levels were associated with higher waist circumference (p = 0.003), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.003), and glucose levels (p = 0.036). Higher zonulin levels were associated with increased risk of overweight (p < 0.001), obesity (p = 0.047), and hyperlipidemia (p = 0.048). We cannot detect altered zonulin levels among individuals reporting GI symptoms or GI diseases, but higher zonulin levels are associated with higher waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and increased risk of metabolic diseases. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Calprotectin is released from neutrophils and monocytes, and increased calprotectin levels in stool may serve as a marker of intestinal inflammation. Intestinal permeability is increased in inflammatory bowel diseases, especially in Crohn disease. We studied the relationship between intestinal permeability and calprotectin concentration in intestinal lavage fluid in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: Thirty-eight patients were examined; 17 had Crohn disease; 3, ulcerative colitis; and 18, irritable bowel syndrome. Intestinal lavage was performed by means of a nasojejunal tube positioned by gastroduodenoscopy. By means of a peristaltic pump 2 1 isotonic polyethylene glycol solution (MW, 3350) containing 50 μCi51 Cr-labelled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were administered through the tube over a period of 40 min. The first clear fluid passed per rectum was collected and analysed for calprotectin levels with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Urine was collected for 5 h and analysed for gamma radioactivity. 51Cr-EDTA excretion in urine was expressed as percentage of dose administered (that is, intestinal permeability). Results: Both intestinal permeability and calprotectin concentration were significantly higher in patients with IBD than in patients with functional conditions. In Crohn disease the values depended on disease activity but not on whether the disease was located in the small or in the large bowel. There was a highly significant correlation between calprotectin concentration in gut lavage fluid and intestinal permeability (r = 0.79, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The significant correlation between calprotectin concentration in gut lavage fluid and intestinal permeability supports the view that increased intestinal permeability in IBD might at least in part, be a consequence of increased transepithelial migration of neutrophils.

AB  - Objective: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gut-brain disorder associated with increased gut permeability. Zonulin has been suggested to regulate the gut barrier and claimed to be pre-haptoglobin 2 (pre-HP2) and circulating zonulin is often used as a proxy for gastrointestinal permeability. This study investigated the correlation between colonic paracellular permeability and levels of circulating zonulin and pre-HP2. Materials and Methods: Colonic biopsies from 32 patients with IBS and 15 healthy controls (HC) were used to measure permeability in Ussing chambers and levels of zonulin (Cusabio ELISA). Zonulin was also measured in blood samples from 40 HC, 78 patients with IBS and 20 patients with celiac disease (CeD), before and after a gluten-free diet. In addition, we verified HP genotype and circulating pre-HP2 using a monoclonal pre-HP2 antibody (Bio-Rad) by ELISA. Results: Increased colonic paracellular permeability correlated positively with zonulin levels in IBS biopsies, but negatively with plasma zonulin. We found no agreement between circulating zonulin and pre-HP2. Genotyping revealed non-specificity of the zonulin kit, as all pre-HP2 non-producers presented detectable levels. Patients with CeD displayed higher pre-HP2 and zonulin levels compared to HC. A gluten-free diet in patients with CeD led to lower serum zonulin and pre-HP2 concentrations. Conclusions: Our study suggests that neither circulating zonulin nor pre-HP2 mirror colonic permeability. Our data corroborate previous reports showing the inability of the Cusabio zonulin kit to target zonulin and highlights that the results of studies using this kit must be re-examined with caution. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating. Interestingly, there is now evidence of the presence of a low-grade inflammatory status in many IBS patients, including histopathological and mucosal cytokine levels in the colon, as well as the presence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The use of a genetically engineered food-grade bacterium, such as Lactococcus lactis, secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been proven by many pre-clinical studies to be a successful therapy to treat colon inflammation. In this study, we first reproduced the recovery-recurrence periods observed in IBS-patients in a new chronic model characterized by 2 episodes of DiNitro-BenzeneSulfonic-acid (DNBS)-challenge and we tested the effects of a recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting IL-10 under a Stress-Inducible Controlled Expression (SICE) system. In vivo gut permeability, colonic serotonin levels, cytokine profiles, and spleen cell populations were then measured as readouts of a low-grade inflammation. In addition, since there is increasing evidence that gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function, tight junction proteins were also measured by qRT-PCR after administration of recombinant L. lactis in DNBS-treated mice. Strikingly, oral administration of L. lactis secreting active IL-10 in mice resulted in significant protective effects in terms of permeability, immune activation, and gut-function parameters. Although genetically engineered bacteria are, for now, used only as a "proof-of-concept," our study validates the interest in the use of the novel SICE system in L. lactis to express therapeutic molecules, such as IL-10, locally at mucosal surfaces. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

AB  - WangShiBoChiWan (WSBCW) is a commonly used Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, its preclinical efficacy and the mechanisms of action have not been adequately studied. The goals of this study were to evaluate the effects of WSBCW on gastrointestinal health and modulation of related biomarkers. Female C57BL mice were randomly assigned into one of the experimental groups consisting of the control, drug controls, and WSBCW at 40, 120, and 360 mg/kg BW. Whole gut transit, small intestinal motility, and intestinal barrier permeability were determined. The castor oil-induced diarrhea mouse model was used to determine the effect of WSBCW on the diarrhea type of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). WSBCW increased whole gut transit and intestinal motility, improved intestinal permeability in healthy animals and alleviated diarrhea symptoms in IBS-D mice. WSBCW upregulated intestinal junction proteins, increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium genus, Desulfovibrio genus and inhibited Bacteroides fragillis group in the gut microbiota, increased intestinal villi lengths, and decreased blood levels of inflammatory cytokines. Our study provided preclinical evidence to verify the effectiveness of WSBCW in gastrointestinal health and elucidate mechanistic insights. The results warrant further investigations to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of WSBCW on gastrointestinal disorders, such as IBS and IBD. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Our previous report determined that miR-144 is a key regulator of intestinal epithelial permeability in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) rats. Recent evidence has shown that lactobacilli play an important role in the relief of IBS-D symptoms. However, few studies have addressed the mechanisms by which microRNAs and lactobacilli exert their beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial permeability. Hence, to elucidate whether miRNAs and lactobacilli play roles in intestinal epithelial barrier regulation, we compared miRNA expression levels in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) under Lactobacillus casei (L. casei LC01) treatment. IECs and L. casei LC01 were co-cultured and then subjected to microRNA microarray assay. qRT-PCR, western blot and ELISA were used to detect the expression of occludin (OCLN) and zonula occludens 1 (ZO1/TJP1). The interaction between miRNAs and L. casei LC01 acting in IECs was investigated through transfection of RNA oligoribonucleotides and pcDNA 3.1 plasmid. The results are as follows: 1) L. casei LC01 decreased the expression of miR-144 and FD4 and promoted OCLN and ZO1 expression in IECs; 2) L. casei LC01 enhanced the barrier function of IECs via downregulation of miR-144 and upregulation of OCLN and ZO1; 3) Under L. casei LC01 treatment, OCLN and ZO1 overexpression could partially eliminate the promoting effect of miR-144 on intestinal permeability in IECs. Our results demonstrate that L. casei LC01 regulates intestinal permeability of IECs through miR-144 targeting of OCLN and ZO1. L. casei LC01 can be a possible therapeutic target for managing dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Copyright© 2020 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology

AB  - Background/Aims Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort accompanied by abnormal bowel movements. In sensitized subjects, ingested nickel (Ni) may induce gastrointestinal symptoms similar to IBS, in addition to typical systemic cutaneous lesions (systemic nickel allergy syndrome [SNAS]). A low nickel diet could improve the systemic manifestations. We evaluated prevalence of nickel allergy in IBS and effects of low Ni diet on (1) gastrointestinal symptoms control, (2) intestinal barrier function, (3) quality of life, and (4) psychological status of patients with IBS and Ni-sensitized patients. Methods Twenty consecutive patients affected by IBS and suspected SNAS underwent intestinal permeability tests. Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated using the visual analogue scale before and after 3 months low Ni diet. Subjects with increased intestinal permeability at baseline repeated nuclear examination after the diet. Results The most frequent profile was diarrhea-predominant IBS (8/20). The low Ni diet induced a significant and constant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and an equally significant improvement of visual analogue scale. Mean urinary output of 51Chromium ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetate (51Cr-EDTA) was 5.91%/24 hr (± 2.08), significantly different from the control group (2.20%/24 hr ± 0.60, P < 0.0001). Conclusion This pilot study shows that low Ni diet improves gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS and SNAS. © 2017 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

AB  - Background: Diarrheal irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), characterized primarily by the presence of diarrhea and abdominal pain, is a clinical manifestation resulting from a multitude of causative factors. Furthermore, Sishen Wan (SSW) has demonstrated efficacy in treating IBS-D. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Methods: A model of IBS-D was induced by a diet containing 45 % lactose and chronic unpredictable mild stress. Additionally, the impact of SSW was assessed by measuring body weight, visceral sensitivity, defecation parameters, intestinal transport velocity, intestinal neurotransmitter levels, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy analysis. Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect the expression of Mucin 2 (MUC2) and Occludin in the colon. Western blotting was used to detect changes in proteins related to tight junction (TJ), autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the colon. Finally, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to monitor the alteration of gut microbiota after SSW treatment. Results: Our study revealed that SSW administration resulted in reduced visceral sensitivity, improved defecation parameters, decreased intestinal transport velocity, and reduced intestinal permeability in IBS-D mice. Furthermore, SSW promotes the secretion of colonic mucus by enhancing autophagy and inhibiting ER stress. SSW treatment caused remodeling of the gut microbiome by increasing the abundance of Blautia, Muribaculum and Ruminococcus torques group. Conclusion: SSW can improve intestinal barrier function by promoting autophagy and inhibiting ER stress, thus exerting a therapeutic effect on IBS-D. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Unspecific gastrointestinal symptoms associated with milk consumption are common. In addition to lactose, also other components of milk may be involved. We studied whether the partial hydrolysation of milk proteins would affect gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects with functional gastrointestinal disorders. In a randomised, placebo-controlled crossover intervention, subjects (n = 41) were given ordinary or hydrolysed high-protein, lactose-free milkshakes (500 mL, 50 g protein) to be consumed daily for ten days. After a washout period of ten days, the other product was consumed for another ten days. Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded daily during the study periods, and a validated irritable bowel syndrome-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) questionnaire was completed at the beginning of the study and at the end of both study periods. Blood and urine samples were analysed for markers of inflammation, intestinal permeability and immune activation. Both the IBS-SSS score (p = 0.001) and total symptom score reported daily (p = 0.002) were significantly reduced when participants consumed the hydrolysed product. Less bloating was reported during both study periods when compared with the baseline (p < 0.01 for both groups). Flatulence (p = 0.01) and heartburn (p = 0.03) decreased when consuming the hydrolysed product but not when drinking the control product. No significant differences in the levels of inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF-α and interleukin 6, IL-6), intestinal permeability (fatty acid binding protein 2, FABP2) or immune activation (1-methylhistamine) were detected between the treatment periods. The results suggest that the partial hydrolysation of milk proteins (mainly casein) reduces subjective symptoms to some extent in subjects with functional gastrointestinal disorders. The mechanism remains to be resolved. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background & Aims We sought to determine the efficacy of psyllium fiber treatment on abdominal pain and stool patterns in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We evaluated effects on breath hydrogen and methane production, gut permeability, and microbiome composition. We also investigated whether psychological characteristics of children or parents affected the response to treatment. Methods We performed a randomized, double-blind trial of 103 children (mean age, 13 ± 3 y) with IBS seen at primary or tertiary care settings. After 2 weeks on their habitual diet, children began an 8-day diet excluding carbohydrates thought to cause symptoms of IBS. Children with ≥75% improvement in abdominal pain were excluded (n = 17). Children were assigned randomly to groups given psyllium (n = 37) or placebo (maltodextrin, n = 47) for 6 weeks. Two-week pain and stool diaries were compared at baseline and during the final 2 weeks of treatment. We assessed breath hydrogen and methane production, intestinal permeability, and the composition of the microbiome before and after administration of psyllium or placebo. Psychological characteristics of children were measured at baseline. Results Children in the psyllium group had a greater reduction in the mean number of pain episodes than children in the placebo group (mean reduction of 8.2 ± 1.2 after receiving psyllium vs mean reduction of 4.1 ± 1.3 after receiving placebo; P = .03); the level of pain intensity did not differ between the groups. Psychological characteristics were not associated with response. At the end of the study period, the percentage of stools that were normal (Bristol scale scores, 3–5), breath hydrogen or methane production, intestinal permeability, and microbiome composition were similar between groups. Conclusions Psyllium fiber reduced the number of abdominal pain episodes in children with IBS, independent of psychological factors. Psyllium did not alter breath hydrogen or methane production, gut permeability, or microbiome composition. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00526903. © 2017 AGA Institute

AB  - Background and Aim: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating are frequent in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like disorders, although little is known about their intestinal ultrastructural alterations. The aim of the present study was to study duodenal biopsies from IBS-like patients to find ultrastructural alterations. Materials and Methods: Study design: descriptive comparative pilot study. Thirty outpatients (9 male and 21 female; median age 37.7 years; range, 20 to 65 years) complaining of IBS-like symptoms were enrolled between January 2015 to May 2019 and were divided into 6 groups, each equally consisting of 5 patients: (A) untreated celiac disease (uCD); (B) treated celiac disease (tCD); (C) wheat allergy (WA); (D) Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS); (E) Nickel allergic contact mucositis (Ni ACM); (F) controls affected by GERD. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) morphological characteristics were: microvilli length, intermicrovillar distance, junctional complexes (JC) gap width, autophagic bodies, apoptosis, altered mitochondria, lipid/chylomicron droplets, and mast cells. Regarding JC, we focused on tight junctions (TJ), adherens junctions (AJ), and desmosomes. Results: Major alterations in microvilli length and intermicrovillar distance have been observed in the subjects affected by uCD. Microvilli of tCD patients showed marked recovery after adequate GFD, although not comparable to controls. Intermediate microvillar alterations were instead observed in NCGS and Ni ACM, while characteristics of WA subjects appeared more similar to tCD. Regarding JC, TJ did not show significant differences between all groups studied, including controls. The AJ were significantly more dilated in all groups compared to controls, while no significant differences were found between the pathological groups. The distance between desmosomes was greater in uCD, NCGS, and Ni ACM than in tCD, WA, and controls. Finally, intracellular alterations have been detected in most of the groups studied although they seemed more unspecific. Conclusions: TEM analysis confirmed damages to the intestinal barrier and defense mechanisms by enterocytes in IBS-like patients, probably linked to low-grade inflammation or adverse reactions triggered by food allergens, heavy metals, or other unknown. On the other hand, our study needs confirmation and further investigations with larger populations to facilitate diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of IBS-like disorders in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: As the accuracy of the "Sugar Test" is currently debated, this study was conducted to focus on how urine volumes may impact the test results. Methods: Fifty-five subjects, 23 healthy and 32 with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), were enrolled. Lactulose and D-mannitol dissolved in water were administered to all the participating subjects; the urine excreted was collected and the total urine volume was measured. The urine samples were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The results were expressed as percentage of urine recovery of lactulose and D-mannitol and lactulose/D-mannitol ratio (LMR). Results: All subjects were divided into two groups: subjects with urine volume <500 mL and subjects with urine volume ≥500 mL. Urine analysis showed that the mean LMR was significantly lower in subjects with urine volume ≥500 mL than in subjects with urine volume <500 mL (0.02 ± 0.02 vs 0.04 ± 0.04; p <0.05). A significant increase in D-mannitol recovery was found to be associated with greater urine volumes (p <0.001). Conclusions: The urine volume may influence urinary excretion of sugar probes. Intake of liquids should therefore be carefully monitored before and during the test and the volume of urine produced over the period of collection should be precisely measured.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests a link between atopic dermatitis (AD) and gastrointestinal disorders, particularly in relation to gut microbial dysbiosis. This study explored the potential exacerbation of AD by gut inflammation and microbial imbalances using an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) mouse model. Chronic gut inflammation was induced in the model by intrarectal injection of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), followed by a 4-week development period. We noted significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the colon and evident gut microbial dysbiosis in the IBS mice. Additionally, these mice exhibited impaired gut barrier function, increased permeability, and elevated systemic inflammation markers such as IL-6 and LPS. A subsequent MC903 challenge on the right cheek lasting for 7 days revealed more severe AD symptoms in IBS mice compared to controls. Further, fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) from IBS mice resulted in aggravated AD symptoms, a result similarly observed with FMT from an IBS patient. Notably, an increased abundance of Alistipes in the feces of IBS mice correlated with heightened systemic and localized inflammation in both the gut and skin. These findings collectively indicate that chronic gut inflammation and microbial dysbiosis in IBS are critical factors exacerbating AD, highlighting the integral relationship between gut and skin health. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) and gut microbiota dysbiosis significantly contribute to the occurrence and development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), exacerbated by stress. Apigenin, a natural flavonoid derived from plants, possesses a range of beneficial properties. However, additional research is necessary to investigate its potential in alleviating symptoms of IBS and elucidating its underlying mechanisms of action. Our study confirms that apigenin effectively reverses mast cell and microglial activation, regulates the composition and abundance of the gut microbiota, improves intestinal barrier function in rats induced with water-avoidance stress, and mitigates VH and colonic hypermotility. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest a potential role of dysbiotic gut microbiota in activating mast cells at the cellular level. Notably, apigenin inhibits mast cell degranulation through the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) / myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) / nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. In conclusion, this study discusses the potential therapeutic effects of apigenin in alleviating VH and modulating the gut-brain axis in water-avoidance stress rats, providing a novel or alternative treatment approach for IBS. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - So far, a comprehensive animal model that can mimic both the central and peripheral pathophysiological changes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is lacking. Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level and colonic 5-HT receptor 3A (5-HT3AR)/5-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired tight junction protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of 5-HT3AR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut microbiota. Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal microbiota transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS. In summary, we established a postinflammatory IBS model covering multifactorial pathophysiological changes, which may help to develop therapies that target specific IBS subtype.—Ma, J., Li, J., Qian, M., He, N., Cao, Y., Liu, Y., Wu, K., He, S.

AB  - Natural compounds like flavonoids preserve intestinal mucosal integrity through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Additionally, some flavonoids show prebiotic abilities, promoting the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria. This study investigates the protective impact of Lens culinaris extract (LE), which is abundant in flavonoids, on intestinal mucosal integrity during LPS-induced inflammation. Using Caco-2 cells as a model for the intestinal barrier, the study found that LE did not affect cell viability but played a cytoprotective role in the presence of LPS. LE improved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and tight junction (TJ) protein levels, which are crucial for barrier integrity. It also countered the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TRPA1 and TRPV1 induced by LPS and reduced pro-inflammatory markers like TNF-α, NF-κB, IL-1β, and IL-8. Moreover, LE reversed the LPS-induced upregulation of AQP8 and TLR-4 expression. These findings emphasize the potential of natural compounds like LE to regulate the intestinal barrier and reduce inflammation’s harmful effects on intestinal cells. More research is required to understand their mechanisms and explore therapeutic applications, especially for gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most frequent and debilitating conditions leading to gastroenterological referrals. However, recommended treatments remain limited, yielding only limited therapeutic gains. Chitin-glucan (CG) is a novel dietary prebiotic classically used in humans at a dosage of 1.5-3.0 g/d and is considered a safe food ingredient by the European Food Safety Authority. To provide an alternative approach to managing patients with IBS, we performed preclinical molecular, cellular, and animal studies to evaluate the role of chitin-glucan in the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in IBS. AIM To evaluate the roles of CG in visceral analgesia, intestinal inflammation, barrier function, and to develop computational molecular models. METHODS Visceral pain was recorded through colorectal distension (CRD) in a model of long-lasting colon hypersensitivity induced by an intra-rectal administration of TNBS [15 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)] in 33 Sprague-Dawley rats. Intracolonic pressure was regularly assessed during the 9 wk-experiment (weeks 0, 3, 5, and 7) in animals receiving CG (n = 14) at a human equivalent dose (HED) of 1.5 g/d or 3.0 g/d and compared to negative control (tap water, n = 11) and positive control (phloroglucinol at 1.5 g/d HED, n = 8) groups. The anti-inflammatory effect of CG was evaluated using clinical and histological scores in 30 C57bl6 male mice with colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administered in their drinking water during 14 d. HT-29 cells under basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with CG to evaluate changes in pathways related to analgesia (µ-opioid receptor (MOR), cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, inflammation [interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1b, and IL-8] and barrier function [mucin 2-5AC, claudin-2, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2] using the real-time PCR method. Molecular modelling of CG, LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and phospholipomannan (PLM) was developed, and the ability of CG to chelate microbial pathogenic lipids was evaluated by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM. RESULTS Daily CG orally-administered to rats or mice was well tolerated without including diarrhea, visceral hypersensitivity, or inflammation, as evaluated at histological and molecular levels. In a model of CRD, CG at a dosage of 3 g/d HED significantly decreased visceral pain perception by 14% after 2 wk of administration (P < 0.01) and reduced inflammation intensity by 50%, resulting in complete regeneration of the colonic mucosa in mice with DSS-induced colitis. To better reproduce the characteristics of visceral pain in patients with IBS, we then measured the therapeutic impact of CG in rats with TNBS-induced inflammation to long-lasting visceral hypersensitivity. CG at a dosage of 1.5 g/d HED decreased visceral pain perception by 20% five weeks after colitis induction (P < 0.01). When the CG dosage was increased to 3.0 g/d HED, this analgesic effect surpassed that of the spasmolytic agent phloroglucinol, manifesting more rapidly within 3 wk and leading to a 50% inhibition of pain perception (P < 0.0001). The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of CG involved, at least in part, a significant induction of MOR, CB2 receptor, and IL-10, as well as a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-8. CG also significantly upregulated barrier-related genes including muc5AC, claudin-2, and ZO-2. Molecular modelling of CG revealed a new property of the molecule as a chelator of microbial pathogenic lipids, sequestering gram-negative LPS and gram-positive LTA bacterial toxins, as well as PLM in fungi at the lowesr energy conformations. CONCLUSION CG decreased visceral perception and intestinal inflammation through master gene regulation and direct binding of microbial products, suggesting that CG may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for patients with IBS or IBS-like symptoms. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - An intestinal permeability test analyzing the differential urinary elimination of lactulose and mannitol orally ingested at the same dosage was carried out first in fasting condition, then combined with specific food ingestion, in 17 children with clinical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Foods were selected based on a suggestive clinical history or on a positive radioaller-gosorbent or prick test. Comparison of the results with those of a control population reported in a previous study showed that in nine IBS patients, specific food ingestion was associated with a modification of intestinal permeability. The nine children all had a personal and/or familial history of allergy and/or raised total IgE. The symptoms disappeared in the nine patients after food exclusion either alone (seven patients) or together with further treatment by cromolyn (two patients). We conclude that, at least in some children, symptoms of IBS may be related to food hypersensitivity. © 1990 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

AB  - Tongxie Yaofang (TXYF), a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with four components as follows: Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (baizhu), Radix Paeoniae Alba (baishao), Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (chenpi) and Radix Saposhnikovia Divaricata (fangfeng), benefits irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nonetheless, proofs of this formula ameliorating D-IBS and T2DM are required. This research aimed at investigating the efficacy of TXYF in treating inflammation in rats with D-IBS and T2DM using animal models. In this study, gavage with high-fat diet, fasciculation, and senna was given to develop rat models with target diseases. To determine intestinal inflammations, major inflammatory factors, and intestinal permeability proteins, H&E staining, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry methods were employed, respectively. This study also utilized Western blot to discover potential inflammatory targets. Results of this research illustrates that TXYF treatment reduced the level of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and raised the IL-10 concentration in liver-depressed spleende ficient rats with D-IBS and T2DM, indicating controlled inflammatory reactions. Staining analysis also showed improved disease states of animal models. Furthermore, efficient rebounds of claudin-1, an intestinal permeability-associated protein, were detected. Moreover, TXYF may treat D-IBS and T2DM in rats via the rage pathway. Copyright © 2022 Xu, Zhang, Lu, Li, Li and Tao.

AB  - Barrier dysfunction is recognized as a pathogenic factor in ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but it is unclear to what extent the factors related to barrier dysfunction are disease-specific. The aim of this study was to compare these aspects in UC patients in remission, IBS patients, and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: Colonic biopsies were collected from 13 patients with UC in remission, 15 patients with IBS-mixed, and 15 HCs. Ulcerative colitis patients had recently been treated for relapse, and biopsies were taken from earlier inflamed areas. Biopsies were mounted in Ussing chambers for measurements of intestinal paracellular permeability to 51chromium (Cr)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). In addition, biopsies were analyzed for mast cells and eosinophils by histological procedures, and plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was assessed by ELISA. Results: Ussing chamber experiments revealed an increased 51Cr-EDTA permeability in UC and IBS (P < 0.05). The 51Cr-EDTA permeability was higher in UC compared with IBS (P < 0.005). There were increased numbers of mucosal mast cells and eosinophils in UC and IBS and more eosinophils in UC compared with IBS (P < 0.05). Also, increased extracellular granule content was found in UC compared with HCs (P < 0.05). The 51Cr-EDTA permeability correlated significantly with eosinophils in all groups. Plasma TNF-α concentration was higher in UC compared with IBS and HCs (P < 0.0005). Conclusions: Results indicate a more permeable intestinal epithelium in inactive UC and IBS compared with HCs. Ulcerative colitis patients, even during remission, demonstrate a leakier barrier compared with IBS. Both eosinophil numbers and activation state might be involved in the increased barrier function seen in UC patients in remission. © 2020 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.

AB  - Background: Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a prevalent pathogenic factor underlying various disorders. Currently there is no effective resolution. Previous studies have reported the potential anti-inflammatory properties of lidocaine and its ability to alleviate visceral hypersensitivity in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, our study will further verify the effect of lidocaine on intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: In this study, we investigated the role of lidocaine by assessing visceral hypersensitivity, body weight, inflammatory factors, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4000 (FD4) flux, tight junctions (TJs) and spleen and thymus index in rats subjected to water avoidance stress (WAS) to mimic intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS with and without lidocaine. In vitro, we investigated the role of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2) in lidocaine-treated Caco2 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CRHR2. Key Results: In WAS rats, lidocaine significantly restored weight loss, damaged TJs, spleen index and thymus index and inhibited abdominal hypersensitivity as well as blood levels of markers indicating intestinal permeability, such as diamine oxidase (DAO), D-lactic acid (D-Lac) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Consequently, the leakage of FD4 flux from intestine was significantly attenuated in lidocaine group, and levels of intestinal inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α) were reduced. Interestingly, lidocaine significantly suppressed corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels in lamina propria cells, while the CRH receptor CRHR2 was upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells. In vitro, lidocaine enhanced the expression of CRHR2 on Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells and restored disrupted TJs and the epithelial barrier caused by LPS. Conversely, these effects were diminished by a CRHR2 antagonist and siRNA-CRHR2, suggesting that the protective effect of lidocaine depends on CRHR2. Conclusions and Inferences: Lidocaine ameliorates intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS by potentially modulating the expression of CRHR2 on intestinal epithelial cells. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a multifactorial chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by inflammation and immune response. In this context, NLRP3 over-activation is associated with a breakdown of enteric-immune balance related to IBS-D. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the inflammasome inhibitor, BAY 11-7082, in a rat model of IBS-D. Syndrome was induced by intracolonic instillation of 1 mL 4% acetic acid at 8 cm proximal to the anus for 30 s and sacrificed 2 weeks after IBS-D induction. BAY 11-7082 (10 and 30 mg/kg) was administered daily by oral gavage. The results obtained showed that the treatment with BAY 11-7082 (30 mg/kg) significantly reduced tissue injury characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration, and loss of colon structure. We demonstrated that BAY 11-7082 treatment inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NF-kB translocation, reducing inflammatory mediators. Moreover, treatment with BAY 11-7082 restored tight junction alteration following IBS-D induction and reduced the restraint stress. Taken together, our data demonstrate that IBS-D induced NLRP3 inflammasome pathway activation, accompanied by the production of proinflammatory response. The modulation of the inflammosome pathway with BAY 11-7082 inhibitor significantly reduced pathological signs of IBS-D, therefore, can be considered a valuable strategy to reduce the development of IBS-D. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity resulting from compromised gut barrier with activated immune system is a key feature of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activate proinflammatory cytokine signaling to induce these changes, which is one of the mechanisms of IBS. As activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or TLR4 leads to release interleukin (IL)-1β, the NLRP3 inflammasome may be involved in the pathophysiology of IBS. Tranilast, an anti-allergic drug has been demonstrated to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, and we evaluated the impact of tranilast on visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability induced by LPS or CRF (IBS rat model). Visceral pain threshold caused by colonic balloon distention was measured by monitoring abdominal muscle contractions electrophysiologically. Colonic permeability was determined by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue within the colonic tissue. Colonic protein levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β were assessed by immunoblot or ELISA. Intragastric administration of tranilast (20–200 mg/kg) for 3 days inhibited LPS (1 mg/kg)-induced visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, tranilast also abolished these alterations induced by CRF (50 µg/kg). LPS increased colonic protein levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β, and tranilast inhibited these changes. β-hydroxy butyrate, an NLRP3 inhibitor, also abolished visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability caused by LPS. In contrast, IL-1β induced similar GI alterations to LPS, which were not modified by tranilast. In conclusion, tranilast improved visceral pain and colonic barrier by suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome in IBS rat models. Tranilast may be useful for IBS treating. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two intestinal diseases with different pathological changes. Electroacupuncture (EA) at Zusanli (ST36) on both IBS and UC is widely used in clinic practice. But it is unclear whether acupuncture at one acupoint can treat two different intestinal diseases at different layers of intestinal barrier. To address this question, we explored three intestinal barrier lesions in IBS and UC mice with the aid of transcriptome data analysis and studied the efficacy of EA at ST36 on them. The transcriptome data analysis showed that both UC and IBS had disrupted intestinal barrier in various layers. And both UC and IBS had epithelial barrier lesions with reduction of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1, while UC rather than IBS had the destruction of the mucus barrier with less MUC2 expression. As to the vascular barrier, UC showed a higher CD31 level and mesenteric blood flow reduction, while IBS showed a lower PV-1 level. EA at ST36 can significantly improve the above lesions of intestinal barrier of IBS and UC. Our results gave more details about the comprehensive protective effect of EA for UC and IBS. We guess the effect of acupuncture may be a kind of homeostasis regulation. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Visceral pain and intestinal dysbiosis are associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a common functional gastrointestinal disorder without available efficient therapies. In this study, a decrease of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii presence has been observed in an IBS-like rodent model induced by a neonatal maternal separation (NMS) stress. Moreover, it was investigated whether F. prausnitzii may have an impact on colonic sensitivity. The A2-165 reference strain, but not its supernatant, significantly decreased colonic hypersensitivity induced by either NMS in mice or partial restraint stress in rats. This effect was associated with a reinforcement of intestinal epithelial barrier. Thus, F. prausnitzii exhibits anti-nociceptive properties, indicating its potential to treat abdominal pain in IBS patients.

AB  - The brain-gut-microbiota (BGM) axis is known to be essential for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). In order to evaluate the effects of IBS-D rat models (the central sensitization model, the peripheral sensitization model and the compound model) on the BGM axis, five models were induced in Wistar rats with 4% acetic acid (AD, dissolved 0.4 ml of AD in 9.6 ml of ultrapure water) + wrap restrain stress (WRS), 4% AD, colorectal distention (CRD), WRS, and neonatal maternal separation (NMS). Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scale scores and the moisture content of feces (MCF) were evaluated on the day of completing modeling. Body weight was measured every 7 days during modeling. Brain gut peptides, cytokine levels, the activity of spinal cord neurons, intestinal mucosal barrier function, and gut microbiota were determined after induction of IBS-D. We found intervention with 4% AD + WRS, 4% AD, CRD, WRS, and NMS induced a similar course of effects on the BGM axis. Among the five models, AWR scores (60 mmHg, 80 mmHg) were all increased. The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, corticotropin-releasing factor, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related protein in serum rapidly increased, whereas that of neuropeptide Y decreased. C-fos in the spinal cord showed increased neuronal activity. The intestinal permeability was increased and the composition and structure of gut microbiota were changed. In conclusion, the five models could cause changes in BGM axis, but the 4% AD + WRS model was closer to the changes BGM axis of post-inflammatory models of IBS-D. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Treatment strategies for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) continue to improve. However, effective drugs are still lacking. Herein, we explored whether sodium hyaluronate (SH) could be used to treat IBS-C. The effects of SH with different molecular weights were compared in a rat model of IBS-C. Low-molecular-weight SH (LMW-SH, 5 ∼ 10 kDa), medium-molecular-weight SH (MMW-SH, 200 ∼ 400 kDa), and high-molecular-weight SH (HMW-SH, 1300 ∼ 1500 kDa) were screened for efficacy in IBS-C using the following indicators: body weight, number of fecal pellets, fecal moisture, visceral hypersensitivity, and gastrointestinal transit rate. H-HMW-SH was the most effective in improving IBS-C symptoms. The ELISA kits indicated that H-HMW-SH reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α in IBS-C rats. In addition, both western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed that H-HMW-SH increased the protein expressions of claudin-1, occludin and zonula occludens-1. Furthermore, H-HMW-SH restored the balance of intestinal flora in different intestinal contents (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon) and feces of rats with IBS-C. Overall, our study illustrates the therapeutic potential of H-HMW-SH in the treatment of IBS-C. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and change of bowel habits without organic disease. Many patients seek alternative IBS treatments because of the limitations of conventional treatments. Gwakhyangjeonggisan (GJS), a herbal formula, has long been used for alleviating diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) in traditional medicine. Duolac7S, which comprises 7 bacterial species as probiotics, has been frequently used for D-IBS. Although GJS and Duolac7S have been administered simultaneously in many D-IBS patients, no study has investigated the effects of GJS and Duolac7S combination therapy on D-IBS. The current trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 4-arm study. After a 2-week run-in period, 60 patients with D-IBS will be randomly assigned to one of the 4 combination groups consisting of GJS (water extract granules, 3 g/pack, 3 times a day) with Duolac7S (powder form, 1 capsule, 2 times a day) or their placebos and followed up for 2 weeks. The assigned treatments will last for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes are adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort and the proportion of responders (on a weekly basis). The secondary outcomes are visual analog scale for IBS symptoms (on a daily basis), quality of life (at 0, 8, and 10 weeks), intestinal permeability, and composition of intestinal microbiota (at 0 and 8 weeks). The present study is designed to examine the safety and efficacy of GJS and Duolac7S combination therapy on D-IBS. Our study provides the clinical evidence of a new therapeutic strategy for D-IBS.

AB  - Background: A valid biomarker is 'an indicator of normal biologic or pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention'. There is no validated biomarker for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the study was to assess ability of three quantitative traits to identify treatable processes to discriminate between IBS-diarrhea (IBS-D) patients, IBS-constipation (IBS-C) patients and healthy volunteers (HV). Methods: In 30 HV, 30 IBS-C patients and 64 IBS-D patients, we characterized bowel symptoms and quantitated pathophysiological mechanisms: bile acid (BA) synthesis (serum C4 and FGF19), fecal BA and fat, colonic transit (CT), and intestinal permeability (IP). We used multiple logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROCAUC) to appraise three factors (fecal BA, CT, and IP) individually and in combination to identify discriminant targets for treatment in IBS. Key Results: There were significant associations between the three subgroups and symptoms reflecting bowel function and the quantitative traits. There were significant associations between fecal BA and CT at 48 h (r = 0.43; p < 0.001) and between fecal BA and IP (r = 0.23; p = 0.015). Individually, fecal BA and CT48 (but not IP) were significant independent predictors for distinguishing HV from IBS. In combination, they discriminated HV from IBS-D patients (ROCAUC 0.70), HV from IBS-C patients (ROCAUC 0.73), and IBS-C patients from IBS-D patients (ROCAUC 0.86). Colonic transit and fecal BA excretion together discriminate between healthy volunteers and IBS-C patients or IBS-D patients, or between the IBS subgroups with 75-90% specificity at 60% sensitivity. Conclusions & Inferences: Colonic transit and fecal BA individually and together constitute useful biomarkers to identify treatable mechanisms in IBS and to differentiate subgroups of IBS. We assessed the ability of three quantitative traits to identify treatable processes to discriminate between IBS-D patients, IBS-C patients, and healthy volunteers. Colonic transit and fecal BA individually and together constitute useful biomarkers to identify treatable mechanisms in IBS and to differentiate subgroups of IBS. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Scope: Since epithelial barrier dysfunction has been associated with gluten and fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyols (FODMAPs), the effect of alterations in FODMAP a gluten intake on epithelial barrier function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who self-reported gluten sensitivity. Methods and results: Circulating concentrations of markers of epithelial injury (syndecan-1 and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein) and bacterial translocation (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and soluble CD14) are measured while consuming habitual gluten-free diet and during blinded challenges with gluten or placebo on a background of low FODMAP intake. In 33 patients, only syndecan-1 concentrations during their habitual diet are elevated (median 43 ng mL−1) compared with 23 ng mL−1 in 49 healthy subjects (p < 0.001). On a low FODMAP diet, symptoms are reduced and levels of syndecan-1 (but not other markers) fell by a median 3335% (p < 0.001) irrespective of whether gluten is present or not. Conclusion: Gluten ingestion has no specific effect on epithelial integrity or symptoms in this cohort, but reducing FODMAP intake concomitantly reduces symptoms and reverses apparent colonic epithelial injury. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of populations self-reporting gluten sensitivity and implicate FODMAPs in colonic injury in IBS. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Foods high in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) exacerbate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, their mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesized that a high-FODMAP (HFM) diet increases visceral nociception by inducing dysbiosis and that the FODMAP-altered gut microbial community leads to intestinal pathology. We fed rats an HFM and showed that HFM increases rat fecal Gram-negative bacteria, elevates lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and induces intestinal pathology, as indicated by inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and visceral hypersensitivity (VH). These manifestations were prevented by antibiotics and reversed by low-FODMAP (LFM) diet. Additionally, intracolonic administration of LPS or fecal supernatant (FS) from HFM-fed rats caused intestinal barrier dysfunction and VH, which were blocked by the LPS antagonist LPS-RS or by TLR4 knockdown. Fecal LPS was higher in IBS patients than in healthy subjects (HS), and IBS patients on a 4-week LFM diet had improved IBS symptoms and reduced fecal LPS levels. Intracolonic administration of FS from IBS patients, but not FS from HS or LFM-treated IBS patients, induced VH in rats, which was ameliorated by LPS-RS. Our findings indicate that HFM-associated gut dysbiosis and elevated fecal LPS levels induce intestinal pathology, thereby modulating visceral nociception and IBS symptomatology, and might provide an explanation for the success of LFM diet in IBS patients.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered defecation, usually accompanied by abdominal bloating or distension. The integrated model of bidirectional interaction between the central, autonomic, enteric nervous system, the microbiome, and the gut barrier allows a better understanding of the pathophysiology of IBS, as well as consideration of potential therapeutic strategies. IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) represents a therapeutic challenge. Dietary changes or restrictions are most commonly used by patients in an attempt at symptom control. Therefore, a number of diets, especially low-FODMAP diet, have increasingly gained interest as a therapy for IBS-D or mixed IBS. However, this kind of diet, while effective, is not exempt of problems. It is therefore necessary that other therapeutic options be considered while bearing pathophysiological mechanisms and general symptom management in mind.

AB  - Introduction. Although combination therapy with herbal medicine and probiotics is gaining popularity for controlling diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS) symptoms, few studies have investigated its clinical effects. Materials and Methods. Fifty-three patients with D-IBS were randomly allocated into 1 of the following 4 groups: herbal medicine (Gwakhyangjeonggisan; GJS) plus probiotics (Duolac7S; DUO), GJS plus placebo DUO, placebo GJS plus DUO, and placebo GJS plus placebo DUO. The study period consisted of a 2-week run-in, 8 weeks of administration, and 2 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcomes were weekly adequate relief (AR) of overall IBS symptoms and the proportion of responders (PR) during the administration period. The secondary outcomes included individual IBS symptoms, stool assessment, and quality of life. Changes of intestinal microbiota and intestinal permeability were also analyzed. Results and Discussion. Weekly AR was not different among the 4 groups throughout the treatment period. However, the 3 treatment groups exhibited significant improvements in PR compared to the findings in the placebo group. In the intestinal microbiota assessment, herbal medicine and probiotics synergistically increased beneficial bacteria counts. Conclusion. Combination therapy with herbal medicine and probiotics appears to relieve overall IBS symptoms by synergistically increasing beneficial intestinal microbe counts. © 2013 Seok-Jae Ko et al.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Approximately 25% of patients with irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea (IBS-D) have increased total fecal bile acids (BA) and serum C4 (surrogate for BA synthesis). BA synthesis-related genes (KLB and FGFR4) are associated with colonic transit (CT) in IBS-D. Our aims were: (i) to compare phenotype and pathophysiology in IBS-D patients with increased or normal fecal excretion or synthesis of BA; and (ii) to explore association of variations in two candidate bile-acid synthesis genes (KLB and FGFR4) in these two subgroups of IBS-D.; METHODS: A total of 64 IBS-D patients underwent on one occasion: fasting serum C4 and FGF19, total fecal fat and BA excretion, CT, intestinal and colonic permeability, and candidate genotyping (rs17618244 (KLB), rs351855 (FGFR4)). Colonic sensation and tone were measured in 47 of the IBS-D patients. IBS-D subgroups were identified by fecal BA >2,337 mM per 48 h or by serum C4 >47.1 ng/ml.; RESULTS: IBS-D patients with fecal BA >2,337 mM per 48 h (19/54) had significantly greater body mass index, fecal fat, percent chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in feces, and intestinal permeability, and borderline increased CT (P=0.13). Those IBS-D patients with serum C4 >47.1 ng/ml (13/54) had increased total fecal BA excretion and borderline increased colonic permeability. Variants in genes involved in feedback regulation of BA synthesis (KLB, P=0.06 and FGFR4, P=0.09) were potentially associated with the subgroup with elevated serum C4.; CONCLUSIONS: IBS-D with increased BA excretion or synthesis is associated with significant pathophysiological changes relative to patients with normal BA profile. BA diarrhea is identified more effectively with total fecal BA than with serum C4.

AB  - An impaired gut barrier, possibly leading to visceral hypersensitivity has been recently recognized to be one of the pivotal pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We previously showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and repeated water avoidance stress (WAS) induce visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability via pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling (rat IBS models). Although the precise mechanisms of action are unclear, imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, improves IBS symptoms, and also has anticytokine properties. In this study, we hypothesized that imipramine improves the gut barrier to ameliorate IBS symptoms. To test this hypothesis, we determined its effects on visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in rat IBS models. The visceral pain threshold in response to colonic balloon distention was electrophysiologically estimated by abdominal muscle contractions, and colonic permeability was measured by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in vivo. Subcutaneous imipramine injection (7, 20, 50 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced (1 mg/kg, subcutaneously) visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. Imipramine also blocked these gastrointestinal (GI) changes induced by CRF (50 μg/kg, intraperitoneally) or repeated WAS (1 h daily for 3 days). Yohimbine (an α2-adrenoceptors antagonist), sulpiride (a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist), and naloxone hydrochloride (an opioid receptor antagonist) reversed these effects of imipramine in the LPS model. Therefore, imipramine may block GI changes in IBS via α2-adrenoceptors, dopamine D2, and opioid signaling. The improvement in the gut barrier resulting in inhibition of visceral pain is considered a valid mechanism of imipramine to ameliorate IBS symptoms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or repeated water avoidance stress (WAS) induces visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and proinflammatory cytokines, which is considered to be a rat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) model. As losartan is known to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine release, we hypothesized that it improves these visceral changes. Methods: The threshold of visceromotor response (VMR), that is, abdominal muscle contractions induced by colonic balloon distention was electrophysiologically measured in rats. Colonic permeability was determined in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue for 15 minutes spectrophotometrically. Key Results: Lipopolysaccharide (1 mg kg−1) subcutaneously (s.c.) reduced the threshold of VMR and increased colonic permeability. Losartan (5-25 mg kg−1 s.c.) for 3 days inhibited these changes in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, repeated WAS (1 hour daily for 3 days) or intraperitoneal injection of CRF (50 µg kg−1) induced the similar visceral changes as LPS, which were also eliminated by losartan. These effects by losartan in LPS model were reversed by GW9662 (a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ [PPAR-γ] antagonist), NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (a nitric oxide [NO] synthesis inhibitor), or naloxone (an opioid receptor antagonist). Moreover, it also inhibited by sulpiride (a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist) or domperidone (a peripheral dopamine D2 antagonist). Conclusion & Inferences: Losartan prevented visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability in rat IBS models. These actions may be PPAR-γ–dependent and also mediated by the NO, opioid, and dopamine D2 pathways. Losartan may be useful for IBS treatment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Stress-induced altered visceral sensation and impaired gut barrier play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These responses were demonstrated to be peripheral corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) dependent and also mediated via proinflammatory cytokine in animal IBS model. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is known to have anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine release. We hypothesized that DHEA-S improves stress-induced visceral changes and is beneficial for IBS treatment. We explored the effects of DHEA-S on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or repeated water avoidance stress (WAS)-induced visceral allodynia and increased colonic permeability (rat IBS models). The threshold of visceromotor response, i.e. abdominal muscle contractions induced by colonic balloon distention was electrophysiologically measured. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue. DHEA-S abolished visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. It also blocked repeated WAS- or peripheral injection of CRF-induced visceral changes. These effects by DHEA-S in LPS model were reversed by bicuculline, a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor antagonist, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor, naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, or sulpiride, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. However, domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist did not modify the effects. Peripheral injection of astressin2-B, a selective CRF receptor subtype 2 (CRF2) antagonist also reversed these effects. In conclusion, DHEA-S blocked stress-induced visceral changes via GABAA, NO, opioid, central dopamine D2 and peripheral CRF2 signaling. DHEA-S may be useful for IBS treating. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Growing evidence indicates that visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In animal models, these changes are known to be mediated via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)-proinflammatory cytokine signaling. Apelin, an endogenous ligand of APJ, was reported to modulate CRF-induced enhanced colonic motility. In this context, we hypothesized that apelin also modulates visceral sensation and gut barrier, and tested this hypothesis. We measured visceral pain threshold in response to colonic balloon distention by abdominal muscle contractions assessed by electromyogram in rats. Colonic permeability was estimated by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue. Intraperitoneal (ip) administration of [Ala13]-apelin-13, an APJ antagonist, blocked lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or CRF-induced visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability (IBS model) in a dose-response manner. These inhibitory effects were blocked by compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor or naloxone in the LPS model. On the other hand, ip [Pyr1]-apelin-13, an APJ agonist, caused visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability, and these effects were reversed by astressin, a CRF receptor antagonist, TAK-242, a TLR4 antagonist or anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. APJ system modulated CRF-TLR4-proinflammatory cytokine signaling to cause visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. APJ antagonist blocked these GI changes in IBS models, which were mediated via AMPK, NO and opioid signaling. Apelin may contribute to the IBS pathophysiology, and the inhibition of apelinergic signaling may be a promising therapeutic option for IBS. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aim: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and stool irregularities. STW 5 has proven clinical efficacy in functional gastrointestinal disorders, including IBS, targeting pathways that suppress inflammation and protect the mucosa. Wnt signaling is known to modulate NF-kβ-dependent inflammatory cytokine production. This sparked the idea of evaluating the impact of STW 5 on the expression of inflammatory-response and Wnt/β catenin-target genes in an IBS-like model. Main methods: We used zebrafish and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment to model IBS-like conditions in vivo and in vitro and examined the effects of subsequent STW 5 treatment on the intestines of DSS-treated fish and primary cultured intestinal and neuronal cells. Gross gut anatomy, histology, and the expression of Wnt-signaling and cytokine genes were analyzed in treated animals and/or cells, and in controls. Key findings: DSS treatment up-regulated the expression of interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, wnt3a, and claudin-1 in explanted zebrafish gut. Subsequent STW 5 treatment abolished both the macroscopic signs of gut inflammation, DSS-induced mucosecretory phenotype, and normalized the DSS-induced upregulated expression of il10 and Wnt signaling genes, such as wnt3a and cldn1 in explanted zebrafish gut. Under inflammatory conditions, STW 5 downregulated the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes il1β, il6, il8, and tnfα while it upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory genes il10 and wnt3a in enteric neuronal cells in vitro. Significance: Wnt signaling could be a novel target for the anti-inflammatory and intestinal permeability-restoring effects of STW 5, possibly explaining its clinical efficacy in IBS. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The Leaky Gut Syndrome - impairment of the gut wall functionality - is involved in many inflammatory diseases, among them IBS. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of arabinogalactan (AG) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on gut wall modulation using a Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®) - inoculated with faecal material from an IBS donor - coupled with co-cultures of enterocytes and macrophages (transwell approach using Caco-2 and THP1 cells). AG and FOS showed a different fermentation profile (more proximal for FOS and distal for AG) and both fibres exerted a potential positive effect on gut barrier (increased TEER parameter) and inflammation (modulation of cytokines IL-8, IL-6, IL-10 and NF-κB) in their main area of fermentation. AG could be an interesting nutritional supplement for the treatment of those conditions characterized by inflammation and increased permeability in the distal colon.

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity and leaky gut, which are mediated via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and Toll-like receptor 4 are key pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Metformin was reported to improve these gastrointestinal (GI) changes. In this study, we attempted to determine the effects of imeglimin, which was synthesized from metformin on GI function in IBS rat models. Imeglimin blocked lipopolysaccharide- or CRF-induced visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. These effects were prevented by compound C or naloxone. These results suggest that imeglimin may be effective for the treatment of IBS by improved visceral sensation and colonic barrier via AMPK and opioid receptor. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) displays chronic abdominal pain with altered defecation. Most of the patients develop visceral hypersensitivity possibly resulting from impaired gut barrier and altered gut microbiota. We previously demonstrated that colonic hyperpermeability with visceral hypersensitivity in animal IBS models, which is mediated via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)–Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–proinflammatory cytokine signaling. CRF impairs gut barrier via TLR4. Leaky gut induces bacterial translocation resulting in dysbiosis, and increases lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of TLR4 by LPS increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which activate visceral sensory neurons to induce visceral hypersensitivity. LPS also activates CRF receptors to further increase gut permeability. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, and recently several researchers suggested the possibility that impaired gut barrier and dysbiosis with low-grade systemic inflammation are involved in MS. Moreover, TLR4–proinflammatory cytokine contributes to the development of insulin resistance and obesity. Thus, the existence of pathophysiological commonality between IBS and MS is expected. This review discusses the potential mechanisms of IBS and MS with reference to gut barrier and microbiota, and explores the possibility of existence of a pathophysiological link between these diseases with a focus on CRF, TLR4, and proinflammatory cytokine signaling. We also review epidemiological data supporting this possibility, and discuss the potential of therapeutic application of the drugs used for MS to IBS treatment. This notion may pave the way for exploring novel therapeutic approaches for these disorders. © 2022 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier with minor inflammation are considered to play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Since pioglitazone is known to have anti-inflammatory property, we hypothesized that pioglitazone is beneficial for treating IBS. In this study, the effect was tested in rat IBS models such as lipopolysaccharide or repeated water avoidance stress-induced visceral allodynia and increased colonic permeability. Pioglitazone blocked these visceral changes, and GW9662, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) antagonist fully reversed the effect by pioglitazone. These results suggest that PPAR-γ activation by pioglitazone may be useful for IBS treatment. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier are crucial contributors to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and those are mediated via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)−Toll like receptor 4–pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. Phlorizin is an inhibitor of sodium-linked glucose transporters (SGLTs), and known to have anti-cytokine properties. Thus, we hypothesized that phlorizin may improve these gastrointestinal changes in IBS, and tested this hypothesis in rat IBS models, i.e., lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or CRF-induced visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. The visceral pain threshold in response to colonic balloon distention was estimated by abdominal muscle contractions by electromyogram, and colonic permeability was measured by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of phlorizin inhibited visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Phlorizin also blocked CRF-induced these gastrointestinal changes. Phlorizin is known to inhibit both SGLT1 and SGLT2, but intragastric administration of phlorizin may only inhibit SGLT1 because gut mainly expresses SGLT1. We found that intragastric phlorizin did not display any effects, but ipragliflozin, an orally active and selective SGLT2 inhibitor improved the gastrointestinal changes in the LPS model. Compound C, an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor and naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist reversed the effects of phlorizin. In conclusions, phlorizin improved visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in IBS models. These effects may result from inhibition of SGLT2, and were mediated via AMPK, NO and opioid pathways. Phlorizin may be effective for the treatment of IBS. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier are crucial pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and injection of lipopolysaccharide or corticotropin-releasing factor, and repeated water avoidance stress simulate these gastrointestinal changes in rat (IBS models). We previously demonstrated that losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist prevented these changes, and we attempted to determine the effects of EMA401, an AT2 receptor antagonist in the current study. EMA401 blocked visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in these models, and naloxone reversed the effects by EMA401. These results suggest that EMA401 may improve gut function via opioid signaling in IBS. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Gut–brain communications disorders in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are associated with intestinal microbiota composition, increased gut permeability, and psychosocial disturbances. Symptoms of IBS are difficult to medicate, and hence much research is being made into alternative approaches. This study assesses the potential of a treatment with pasteurized Akkermansia muciniphila for alleviating IBS-like symptoms in two mouse models of IBS with different etiologies. Two clinically relevant animal models were used to mimic IBS-like symptoms in C57BL6/J mice: the neonatal maternal separation (NMS) paradigm and the Citrobacter rodentium infection model. In both models, gut permeability, colonic sensitivity, fecal microbiota composition and colonic IL-22 expression were evaluated. The cognitive performance and emotional state of the animals were also assessed by several tests in the C. rodentium infection model. The neuromodulation ability of pasteurized A. muciniphila was assessed on primary neuronal cells from mice dorsal root ganglia using a ratiometric calcium imaging approach. The administration of pasteurized A. muciniphila significantly reduced colonic hypersensitivity in both IBS mouse models, accompanied by a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier function. Beneficial effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila treatment have also been observed on anxiety-like behavior and memory defects in the C. rodentium infection model. Finally, a neuroinhibitory effect exerted by pasteurized A. muciniphila was observed on neuronal cells stimulated with two algogenic substances such as capsaicin and inflammatory soup. Our findings demonstrate novel anti-hyperalgesic and neuroinhibitory properties of pasteurized A. muciniphila, which therefore may have beneficial effects in relieving pain and anxiety in subjects with IBS. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Although gut microbiota and early life events are likely involved in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it remains unclear how these factors interact in the pathophysiology of IBS. In the present study, using rats subjected to maternal separation (MS) as a model of IBS, we investigated interrelationships among gut microbiota, stress susceptibility and intestinal permeability, and examined the effect of the probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1 (BBG9-1) on those interrelationships. When compared with the controls at postnatal day 20, MS rats showed hypercorticosteronemia, enhanced intestinal permeability and changes in gut microbiota structure. All of these changes in MS rats were prevented by treatment with BBG9-1. Although the gut microbiota profile and basal serum corticosterone level did not differ between MS and control rats at postnatal day 56, MS rats showed hypersensitivity to restraint stress in terms of serum corticosterone level and fecal frequency. However, such hypersensitivity was not observed in MS rats treated with BBG9-1. These findings suggest that MS initiates the link between gut microbiota alteration and hypersensitivity to stress and that the triggering of this process can be prevented by the treatment with the probiotic BBG9-1. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Opioid-dependent immune-mediated analgesic effects have been broadly reported upon inflammation. In preclinical mouse models of intestinal inflammatory diseases, the local release of enkephalins (endogenous opioids) by colitogenic T lymphocytes alleviate inflammation-induced pain by down-modulating gut-innervating nociceptor activation in periphery. In this study, we wondered whether this immune cell-derived enkephalin-mediated regulation of the nociceptor activity also operates under steady state conditions. Here, we show that chimeric mice engrafted with enkephalin-deficient bone marrow cells exhibit not only visceral hypersensitivity but also an increase in both epithelial paracellular and transcellular permeability, an alteration of the microbial topography resulting in increased bacteria-epithelium interactions and a higher frequency of IgA-producing plasma cells in Peyer’s patches. All these alterations of the intestinal homeostasis are associated with an anxiety-like behavior despite the absence of an overt inflammation as observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, our results show that immune cell-derived enkephalins play a pivotal role in maintaining gut homeostasis and normal behavior in mice. Because a defect in the mucosal opioid system remarkably mimics some major clinical symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome, its identification might help to stratify subgroups of patients. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder. Traditionally, early life stress (ELS) is predisposed to IBS in adult. However, whether ELS induces IBS in early life remains unclear. Methods: Separated cohort studies were conducted in neonatal male pups of C57BL/6 mice by maternal separation (MS) model. MS and non-separation mice were scheduled to be evaluated for prime IBS-phenotypes, including visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal motility, intestinal permeability, and anxiety-like behavior. Ileal contents and fecal samples were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bacterial community analyses. Subcellular structures of intestinal epithelial, such as epithelial tight junctions and mitochondria, were observed under transmission electron microscopy. Results: MS induced visceral hypersensitivity and decreased total intestinal transit time from childhood to adulthood. In addition, MS induced intestinal hyperpermeability and anxiety-like behavior from adolescence to adulthood. Besides, MS affected intestinal microbial composition from childhood to adulthood. Moreover, MS disrupted intestinal mitochondrial structure from childhood to adulthood. Conclusion: The study showed for the first time that MS induced IBS from early life to adulthood in mice. The disrupted intestinal mitochondrial structure and the significant dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota in early life may contribute to the initiation and progress of IBS from early life to adulthood.

AB  - Background & aims: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is more prevalent in women. Vitamin D deficiency and hormonal disorders are also prevalent in Iranian women, and may influence the severity of clinical outcomes mediated by microinflammation, oxidative stress and intestinal permeability pathways. Our objective was to investigate the effects of co-administration of soy and vitamin D on some inflammatory, antioxidant and gut permeability markers in women with IBS. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, women (18–75 years of age) were randomly allocated into four groups to receive soy isoflavones (40 mg/day), cholecalciferol (50,000 IU/15 days), both soy isoflavones and cholecalciferol, or placebo for six weeks. The outcomes were plasma inflammatory markers, antioxidant status and fecal protease activity at week 0 and week 6. Results: After the intervention, plasma inflammatory markers and fecal protease activity were reduced significantly in all treatment groups compared to the placebo group; however, there was no significant effect on antioxidant status. Conclusion: This study suggests combined supplementation of soy isoflavones and active vitamin D can improve some biochemical parameters regarding inflammation and intestinal permeability of IBS in women.

AB  - Changes in microbiome composition are associated with a wide array of human diseases, turning the human microbiota into an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Yet, clinical translation of these findings requires the establishment of causative connections between specific microbial taxa and their functional impact on host tissues. Here, we infuse gut organ cultures with longitudinal microbiota samples collected from therapy-naive patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) under a low-fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet. We show that post-diet microbiota regulates intestinal expression of inflammatory and neuro-muscular gene sets. Specifically, we identify Bifidobacterium adolescentis as a diet-sensitive pathobiont that alters tight junction integrity and disrupts gut barrier functions. Collectively, we present a pathway discovery platform for mechanistic dissection and identification of functional diet-host-microbiota modules. Our data support the hypothesis that the gut microbiota mediates the beneficial effects of a low-FODMAP diet and reinforce the potential feasibility of microbiome-based therapies in IBS. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Increased intestinal barrier permeability has been correlated with aging and disease, including type 2 diabetes, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis and irritable bowel syndrome. The prevalence of these ailments has risen together with an increase in industrial food processing and food additive consumption. Additives, including sugar, metal oxide nanoparticles, surfactants and sodium chloride, have all been suggested to increase intestinal permeability. We used two complementary model systems to examine the effects of food additives on gut barrier function: a Drosophila in vivo model and an in vitro human cell co-culture model. Of the additives tested, intestinal permeability was increased most dramatically by high sugar. High sugar also increased feeding but reduced gut and overall animal size. We also examined how food additives affected the activity of a gut mucosal defense factor, intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), which fluctuates with bacterial load and affects intestinal permeability. We found that high sugar reduced IAP activity in both models. Artificial manipulation of the microbiome influenced gut permeability in both models, revealing a complex relationship between the two. This study extends previous work in flies and humans showing that diet can play a role in the health of the gut barrier. Moreover, simple models can be used to study mechanisms underlying the effects of diet on gut permeability and function. © 2018. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Probiotic supplementation can help to mitigate the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by reinforcing the intestinal barrier, and reducing both inflammation and proteolytic activity. Here, a combination of in vitro tests was performed on 33 Bifidobacterium strains as probiotic candidates for IBS. In addition to the classical tests performed, the detection of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) enzyme capable of decreasing the high proteolytic activity found in IBS patients was included. Three serpin-positive strains were selected: Bifidobacterium breve CNCM I-5644, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis CNCM I-5645 and B. longum CNCM I-5646 for their immunomodulation properties and protection of intestinal epithelial integrity in vitro. Furthermore, we found that B. breve CNCM I-5644 strain prevented intestinal hyperpermeability by upregulating Cingulin and Tight Junction Protein 1 mRNA levels and reducing pro-inflammatory markers. The ability of CNCM I-5644 strain to restore intestinal hyperpermeability (FITC-dextran) was shown in the murine model of low-grade inflammation induced by dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS). This effect of this strain was corroborated in a second model of IBS, the neonatal maternal separation model in mice. Altogether, these data suggest that serpin-positive B. breve CNCM I-5644 may partially prevent disorders associated with increased barrier permeability such as IBS. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - An overlap of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) exists across subtype groups. Symptoms include intestinal gas, diarrhea, dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal pain, and constipation. The unifying symptom may be excessive intestinal gas as a by-product of intestinal microbial fermentation. Abnormal fermentation of food takes place when gut microbes expand proximally into the small intestine instead of being confined predominantly to the colon. Such proximal expansion of indigenous gut microbes or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may lead to activation of host mucosal immunity and an increase in intestinal permeability to result in flu-like extra-intestinal symptoms that accompany the classic IBS symptoms of altered bowels. The presence of methane on lactulose breath testing is associated with constipation-predominant IBS. Antibiotic therapy may be appropriate to treat underlying SIBO in IBS patients. Seventy-five percent improvement of IBS symptoms was reported in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study once antibiotics succeeded in treating bacterial overgrowth. Once a good clinical response and normalization of the lactulose breath test are achieved, a prokinetic agent may be used to stimulate phase III of interdigestive motility to delay relapse of bacterial overgrowth. © 2005 MedReviews, LLC.

AB  - Background Fermented milk (FM) containing Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM I-2494 and yogurt strains improves irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in constipated IBS patients. In rats, stressful events exacerbate IBS symptoms and result in the alteration of gut sensitivity and permeability via epithelial cell cytoskeleton contraction. In a stress model, we aimed at evaluating the effect of B. lactis CNCM I-2494 as a pure strain or contained in an FM product on visceral sensitivity and the impact of this FM on intestinal barrier integrity. Methods Visceral sensitivity was analyzed in rats subjected to partial restraint stress (PRS). Rats received during 15days the B. lactis as a pure strain (10 6 to 10 10CFUmL -1), B. lactis in an FM product (10 8CFUg -1, diluted or not), or a control product. Gut paracellular permeability, colonic occluding and Jam-A proteins, and blood endotoxin levels were determined in rats receiving B. lactis in an FM product submitted or not to a PRS. Key Results The FM product showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity. A similar antihyperalgesic effect was observed at 10 10CFUmL -1 of pure B. lactis administration. The FM product prevented the increase in intestinal permeability induced by PRS and restored occludin and JAM-A expressions to control levels. The FM product abolished the increase concentration of blood endotoxin induced by PRS. Conclusions & Inferences This study illustrates that a probiotic food containing B. lactis CNCM I-2494 strain reduces visceral hypersensitivity associated with acute stress by normalizing intestinal epithelial barrier via a synergistic interplay with the different probiotic strains and/or metabolites contained in this product. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional intestinal disorder without clear pathological mechanisms. Classical treatments for IBS are not always effective and are usually accompanied by side effects. Selenium-enriched Bifidobacterium longum DD98 (Se-B. longum DD98) is a selenized probiotic strain which has shown many beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal tract, but its effects on IBS and the underlying mechanism are unclear. This study aims to investigate the relieving effects of Se-B. longum DD98 on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced IBS in mice. The model mice were treated with saline, B. longum DD98, or Se-B. longum DD98 while receiving CUMS. The results suggest that Se-B. longum DD98 significantly relieved the intestinal symptoms of IBS mice and reduced intestinal permeability and inflammation. The depression and anxiety-like behaviors of IBS mice were also improved by Se-B. longum DD98. In addition, the expression of serotonin (5-HT), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are indicators closely related to mood and brain-gut axis, were up-regulated in mice treated with Se-B. longum DD98. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA sequencing study showed that Se-B. longum DD98 effectively restored the relative abundance of intestinal microbes (e.g., Lactobacillus, Desulfovibrio, Akkermansia) and regulated the impaired diversity of gut microbiota in IBS mice. These results suggest that Se-B. longum DD98 positively acts on the brain-gut axis by improving intestinal functions and regulating mood-associated behaviors and indicators of IBS mice. Therefore, this Se-enriched probiotic strain could be considered a promising candidate for the alleviation of CUMS-induced IBS. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In the past few years, increasing attention has been given to the pathologic role of specific foods in IBS, like wheat and other cereals. Recent literature describes IBS patients who may experience gastrointestinal (GI) and extra-GI symptoms precipitated by the ingestion of cereals. Tritordeum is a cereal of Spanish origin derived from the hybridization of durum wheat and wild barley. It is different from classic wheat for its gluten protein composition, with fewer carbohydrates and fructans and a higher content of proteins, dietary fibers, and antioxidants. This pilot study aimed to investigate the effects of a 12-week diet with Tritordeum-based foods in substitution of other cereals on the profile of GI symptoms (evaluated by appropriate questionnaire) and the health of the GI barrier (assessed by sugar absorption test and different markers of integrity and functions) in 16 diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients. The diet with Tritordeum-based foods (bread, bakery products, and pasta) significantly reduced IBS-D patients' symptoms. This amelioration appears to occur through an overall improvement of the GI barrier, as demonstrated by the reduced intestinal permeability and the decreased levels of markers of intestinal mucosal integrity, mucosal inflammation, and fermentative dysbiosis.

AB  - Treatment of functional digestive disorders is not always effective. Therefore, a search for new application points for potential drugs is perspective. Our aim is to evaluate the effect of rebamipide on symptom severity, intestinal barrier status, and intestinal microbiota composition and function in patients with diarrheal variant of irritable bowel syndrome overlapping with functional dyspepsia (D-IBSoFD). Sixty patients were randomized to receive trimebutine (TRI group), trimebutine + rebamipide (T + R group), or rebamipide (REB group) for 2 months. At the beginning and end of the study, patients were assessed for general health (SF-36), severity of digestive symptoms (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating and 7 × 7 scales), state of the intestinal barrier, and composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and function (short-chain fatty acid fecal content) of the gut microbiota. The severity of most digestive symptoms was reduced in the REB and T + R groups to levels similar to that observed in the TRI group. The duodenal and sigmoidal lymphocytic and sigmoidal eosinophilic infiltration was decreased only in the REB and T + R groups, not in the TRI group. Serum zonulin levels were significantly decreased only in the REB group. A decrease in intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration in the duodenum correlated with a decrease in the severity of rumbling and flatulence, while a decrease in infiltration within the sigmoid colon correlated with improved stool consistency and decreased severity of the sensation of incomplete bowel emptying. In conclusion, rebamipide improves the intestinal barrier condition and symptoms in D-IBSoFD. The rebamipide effects are not inferior to those of trimebutine. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Previously we showed that urine trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) levels were higher in females with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) compared to non-IBS females. To assess if TFF3 is associated with symptoms and/or reflect alterations in gastrointestinal permeability and gut microbiota in an IBS population, we correlated stool and urine TFF3 levels with IBS symptoms, intestinal permeability, stool microbial diversity and relative abundance of predominant bacterial families and genera. We also tested the relationship of stool TFF3 to urine TFF3, and compared results based on hormone contraception use. Samples were obtained from 93 females meeting Rome III IBS criteria and completing 4-week symptom diaries. TFF3 levels were measured by ELISA. Permeability was assessed with the urine lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio. Stool microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA. Stool TFF3, but not urine TFF3, was associated positively with diarrhoea and loose stool consistency. Higher stool TFF3 was also associated with lower L/M ratio and microbial diversity. Of the 20 most abundant bacterial families Mogibacteriaceae and Christensenellaceae were inversely related to stool TFF3, with only Christensenellaceae remaining significant after multiple comparison adjustment. There were no significant relationships between stool or urine TFF3 levels and other symptoms, nor between stool and urine levels. In premenopausal females, urine TFF3 levels were higher in those reporting hormone contraception. Collectively these results suggest that higher stool TFF3 levels are associated with IBS symptoms (loose/diarrhoeal stools), lower gut permeability, and altered stool bacteria composition (decreased diversity and decreased Christensenellaceae), which further suggests that TFF3 may be an important marker of host-bacteria interaction. © 2018 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

AB  - BackgroundThe totality of bacteria, protozoa, viruses and fungi that lives in the human body is called microbiota. Human microbiota specifically colonizes the skin, the respiratory and urinary tract, the urogenital tract and the gastrointestinal system. This study focuses on the intestinal microbiota to explore the drug-microbiota relationship and, therefore, how the drug bioavailability changes in relation to the microbiota biodiversity to identify more personalized therapies, with the minimum risk of side effects. MethodsTo achieve this goal, we developed a new mathematical model with two compartments, the intestine and the blood, which takes into account the colonic mucosal permeability variation - measured by Ussing chamber system on human colonic mucosal biopsies - and the fecal microbiota composition, determined through microbiota 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. Both of the clinical parameters were evaluated in a group of Irritable Bowel Syndrome patients compared to a group of healthy controls. Key ResultsThe results show that plasma drug concentration increases as bacterial concentration decreases, while it decreases as intestinal length decreases too. ConclusionsThe study provides interesting data since in literature there are not yet mathematical models with these features, in which the importance of intestinal microbiota, the ”forgotten organ”, is considered both for the subject health state and in the nutrients and drugs metabolism. © 2021

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, sometimes debilitating, gastrointestinal disorder worldwide. While altered gut motility and sensation, as well as aberrant brain perception of visceral events, are thought to contribute to the genesis of symptoms in IBS, a search for an underlying aetiology has, to date, proven unsuccessful. Recently, attention has been focused on the microbiota as a possible factor in the pathogenesis of IBS. Prompted by a number of clinical observations, such as the recognition of the de novo development of IBS following enteric infections, as well as descriptions of changes in colonic bacterial populations in IBS and supported by clinical responses to interventions, such as antibiotics and probiotics, that modify the microbiota, various approaches have been taken to investigating the microbiota-host response in IBS, as well as in animal models thereof. From such studies a considerable body of evidence has accumulated to indicate the activation or upregulation of both factors involved in bacterial engagement with the host as well host defence mechanisms against bacteria. Alterations in gut barrier function, occurring in response, or in parallel, to changes in the microbiota, have also been widely described and can be seen to play a pivotal role in generating and sustaining host immune responses both within and beyond the gut. In this manner a plausible hypothesis, based on an altered microbiota and/or an aberrant host response, for the pathogenesis, of at least some instances of IBS, can be generated. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

AB  - Giardia duodenalis is a prevalent cause of acute diarrheal disease worldwide. However, recent outbreaks in Italy and Norway have revealed a link between giardiasis and the subsequent development of chronic post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. While the mechanisms underlying the causation of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome remain obscure, recent findings suggest that alterations in gut microbiota communities are linked to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome. In the present study, we use a laboratory biofilm system to culture and enrich mucosal microbiota from human intestinal biopsies. Subsequently, we show that co-culture with Giardia induces disturbances in biofilm species composition and biofilm structure resulting in microbiota communities that are intrinsically dysbiotic – even after the clearance of Giardia. These microbiota abnormalities were mediated in part by secretory-excretory Giardia cysteine proteases. Using in vitro cell culture and germ-free murine infection models, we show that Giardia-induced disruptions of microbiota promote bacterial invasion, resulting in epithelial apoptosis, tight junctional disruption, and bacterial translocation across an intestinal epithelial barrier. Additionally, these dysbiotic microbiota communities resulted in increased activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 signalling pathway, and overproduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in humanized germ-free mice. Previous studies that have sought explanations and risk factors for the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome have focused on features of enteropathogens and attributes of the infected host. We propose that polymicrobial interactions involving Giardia and gut microbiota may cause persistent dysbiosis, offering a new interpretation of the reasons why those afflicted with giardiasis are predisposed to gastrointestinal disorders post-infection. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - Objective Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterised by intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing foods, in the absence of coeliac disease (CD) and wheat allergy. No biomarkers are available to diagnose NCGS and the gold standard double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge is clinically impractical. The aim of our work was to investigate the role of serum zonulin as a diagnostic biomarker of NCGS and to develop a diagnostic algorithm. Design In a multicentre study, we enrolled 86 patients with either self-reported or double-blind confirmed NCGS, 59 patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 15 patients with CD and 25 asymptomatic controls (AC). Zonulin serum levels were assessed and the associated diagnostic power calculated. Clinical and symptomatic data were recorded. The effect of diet on zonulin levels was evaluated in a subgroup of patients with NCGS. Results Compared with ACs, the NCGS, irrespective of modality of diagnosis, and patients with CD had significantly increased levels of zonulin, as did both NCGS and patients with CD compared with participants with IBS-D. Self-reported NCGS showed increased zonulin levels compared with double-blind confirmed and not-confirmed NCGS. Six-month wheat avoidance significantly reduced zonulin levels only in HLA-DQ2/8-positive participants with NCGS. The diagnostic accuracy of zonulin levels in distinguishing NCGS from IBS-D was 81%. After exclusion of CD, a diagnostic algorithm combining zonulin levels, symptoms and gender improved the accuracy to 89%. Conclusion Zonulin can be considered a diagnostic biomarker in NCGS and combined with demographic and clinical data differentiates NCGS from IBS-D with high accuracy. Wheat withdrawal was associated with a reduction in zonulin levels only in NCGS carrying HLA genotype.  ©

AB  - Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT5716, a probiotic strain isolated from human milk, has reported beneficial effects on different gastrointestinal disorders. Moreover, it has shown its ability to restore altered immune responses, in association with microbiome modulation in different pathological conditions. Therefore, our aim was to assess the effects of a Limosilacbacillus fermentum CECT5716 in a rat experimental model of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that resembles human IBS. The experimental IBS was induced by deoxycholic acid (DCA) in rats and then, Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 (109 CFU/day/rat) was administered. Behavioral studies, hyperalgesia and intestinal hypersensitivity determinations were performed and the impact of the probiotic on the inflammatory and intestinal barrier integrity was evaluated. Additionally, the gut microbiota composition was analyzed. Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 attenuated the anxiety-like behavior as well as the visceral hypersensitivity and referred pain. Moreover, this probiotic ameliorated the gut inflammatory status, re-establishing the altered intestinal permeability, reducing the mast cell degranulation and re-establishing the gut dysbiosis in experimental IBS. Therefore, our results suggest a potential use of Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 in clinical practice for the management of IBS patients. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Aim. Lactulose/mannitol ratio is used to assess intestinal barrier function. Aim of this work was to develop a robust and rapid method for the analysis of lactulose and mannitol in urine by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Lactulose/mannitol ratio has been measured in pediatric patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome. Methods. Calibration curves and raffinose, used as internal standard, were prepared in water: acetonitrile 20: 80. Fifty μL of urine sample was added to 450 μL of internal standard solution. The chromatographic separation was performed using a Luna NH2 column operating at a flow rate of 200 μL/min and eluted with a linear gradient from 20% to 80% water in acetonitrile. Total run time is 9 minutes. The mass spectrometry operates in electrospray negative mode. Method was fully validated according to European Medicine Agency guidelines. Results and Conclusions. Linearity ranged from 10 to 1000 mg/L for mannitol and 2.5 to 1000 mg/L for lactulose. Imprecision in intra- and interassay was lower than 15% for both analytes. Accuracy was higher than 85%. Lactulose/mannitol ratio in pediatric patients is significantly higher than that measured in controls. The presented method, rapid and sensitive, is suitable in a clinical laboratory.

AB  - The pathobiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is multifaceted. We aimed to identify candidate genes predisposing to quantitative traits in IBS. In 30 healthy volunteers, 30 IBS-constipation, and 64 IBS-diarrhea patients, we measured bowel symptoms, bile acid (BA) synthesis (serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and FGF19), fecal BA and fat, colonic transit (CT by scintigraphy), and intestinal permeability (IP by 2-sugar excretion). We assessed associations of candidate genes controlling BA metabolism (KLB rs17618244 and FGFR4 rs351855), BA receptor (GPBAR1 rs11554825), serotonin (5-HT) reuptake (SLC6A4 through rs4795541 which encodes for the 44-bp insert in 5HTTLPR), or immune activation (TNFSF15 rs4263839) with three primary quantitative traits of interest: colonic transit, BA synthesis, and fecal BA excretion. There were significant associations between fecal BA and CT at 48 h (r = 0.43; P < 0.001) and IP (r = 0.23; P = 0.015). GPBAR1 genotype was associated with CT48 (P = 0.003) and total fecal BA [P = 0.030, false detection rate (FDR) P = 0.033]. Faster CT48 observed with both CC and TT GPBAR1 genotypes was due to significant interaction with G allele of KLB, which increases BA synthesis and excretion. Other univariate associations (P < 0.05, without FDR correction) observed between GPBAR1 and symptom phenotype and gas sensation ratings support the role of GPBAR1 receptor. Associations between SLC6A4 and stool consistency, ease of passage, postprandial colonic tone, and total fecal BA excretion provide data in support of future hypothesis-testing studies. Genetic control of GPBAR1 receptor predisposing to pathobiological mechanisms in IBS provides evidence from humans in support of the importance of GPBAR1 to colonic motor and secretory functions demonstrated in animal studies. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background: Ghrelin levels and obestatin/ghrelin ratio have been proposed as activity markers in ulcerative colitis, but no data are available in celiac disease (CD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our aims were as follows: (a) to assess obestatin and ghrelin concentrations in adult active CD patients, diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-d), and healthy controls (HC) in relation to intestinal permeability; (b) to evaluate the ghrelin-obestatin profile in CD patients after a 1-year gluten-free diet (GFD); and (c) to establish the impact of ghrelin genetics. Methods: The study included 31 CD patients, 28 IBS-d patients, and 19 HC. Intestinal permeability, assayed by highperformance liquid chromatography determination of urinary lactulose (La)/mannitol (Ma), and circulating concentrations of obestatin, ghrelin, and their ratio were evaluated at enrollment and after GFD. The ghrelin single nucleotide polymorphisms Arg51Gln (rs34911341), Leu72Met (rs696217), and Gln90Leu (rs4684677) were analyzed. Results: Intestinal permeability was impaired in CD patients and ameliorated after GFD. Ghrelin was significantly (P =0.048) higher and the obestatin/ghrelin ratio was significantly (P= 0.034) lower in CD patients compared with both IBS-d and HC, and GFD reduced the peptide levels, but without reaching the concentrations in HC. Significant differences (P< 0.05) were found in the Leu72Met polymorphism among groups, with the reduction of the GT genotype and the T allele in both CD and IBS-d patients compared with HC. Conclusion: Intestinal permeability is altered in CD, but not in IBS-d patients, and ghrelin levels increase in CD patients as observed in other inflammatory conditions. Moreover, a role for ghrelin genetics is hypothesized in sustaining the many pathogenetic components of these different pathologies, but with a similar symptom profile.

AB  - Background & Aims: Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a technique that permits real-time detection and quantification of changes in intestinal tissues and cells, including increases in intraepithelial lymphocytes and fluid extravasation through epithelial leaks. Using CLE analysis of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), we found that more than half have responses to specific food components. Exclusion of the defined food led to long-term symptom relief. We used the results of CLE to detect reactions to food in a larger patient population and analyzed duodenal biopsy samples and fluid from patients to investigate mechanisms of these reactions. Methods: In a prospective study, 155 patients with IBS received 4 challenges with each of 4 common food components via the endoscope, followed by CLE, at a tertiary medical center. Classical food allergies were excluded by negative results from immunoglobulin E serology analysis and skin tests for common food antigens. Duodenal biopsy samples and fluid were collected 2 weeks before and immediately after CLE and were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblots. Results from patients who had a response to food during CLE (CLE+) were compared with results from patients who did not have a reaction during CLE (CLE–) or healthy individuals (controls). Results: Of the 108 patients who completed the study, 76 were CLE+ (70%), and 46 of these (61%) reacted to wheat. CLE+ patients had a 4-fold increase in prevalence of atopic disorders compared with controls (P =.001). Numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes were significantly higher in duodenal biopsy samples from CLE+ vs CLE– patients or controls (P =.001). Expression of claudin-2 increased from crypt to villus tip (P <.001) and was up-regulated in CLE+ patients compared with CLE– patients or controls (P =.023). Levels of occludin were lower in duodenal biopsy samples from CLE+ patients vs controls (P =.022) and were lowest in villus tips (P <.001). Levels of messenger RNAs encoding inflammatory cytokines were unchanged in duodenal tissues after CLE challenge, but eosinophil degranulation increased, and levels of eosinophilic cationic protein were higher in duodenal fluid from CLE+ patients than controls (P =.03). Conclusions: In a CLE analysis of patients with IBS, we found that more than 50% of patients could have nonclassical food allergy, with immediate disruption of the intestinal barrier upon exposure to food antigens. Duodenal tissues from patients with responses to food components during CLE had immediate increases in expression of claudin-2 and decreases in occludin. CLE+ patients also had increased eosinophil degranulation, indicating an atypical food allergy characterized by eosinophil activation. © 2019 AGA Institute

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with clinical signs typical of 'intestinal' food allergies or intolerance. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical features of IBS patients suspected of suffering from adverse reactions to food. METHODS: The study involved 128 consecutive IBS patients divided into four groups according to their main symptom on presentation at our outpatient clinic. A detailed medical history was recorded, paying particular attention to any allergies and reported intolerance to food. Each patient was screened for allergies; intestinal permeability tests was performed in randomly selected patients from different groups. Findings were analyzed using the X2 test. RESULTS: Adverse reactions to one or more foods were reported by 80 patients (62.5%); skin prick tests (SPT) were positive in 67 patients (52.3%) with no significant differences between patients complaining of different symptoms. Patients who reported a food intolerance had more positive SPTs than those who did not (47 of 80 [58.7%] vs 20 of 48 [41.7%]); this difference was not statistically significant, although it suggests a trend (p < 0.0610). There was little consistency between the specific foods reported to cause intolerance and those resulting from the tests (11 of 80 patients, 13.7%). The intestinal permeability test was normal in 29 of 33 patients (87.9%). CONCLUSIONS: More than 50% of IBS patients were found sensitized to some food or inhalant without any typical clinical signs. Patients were unable to identify potentially offending foods. The lack of a correlation between SPT results and reported food allergies needs further investigation to clarify the pathophysiology and improve the diagnosis of intestinal food allergies.

AB  - Background and Aims: Differentiating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) from those of organic intestinal disease is a familiar problem for physicians. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios (ORs) of fecal calprotectin, small intestinal permeability, Rome I criteria, and laboratory markers of inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], blood count) in distinguishing organic from nonorganic intestinal disease. Methods: A total of 602 new referrals to a gastroenterology clinic who had symptoms suggestive of IBS or organic intestinal disease were studied for these parameters. All patients underwent invasive imaging (barium/endoscopic examination) and other investigations as appropriate, with physicians blinded to the results of fecal calprotectin and intestinal permeability. Results: A total of 263 patients were diagnosed with organic disease and 339 with IBS. At 10 mg/L, the sensitivity and specificity of calprotectin for organic disease were 89% and 79%, respectively, and that of intestinal permeability for small intestinal disease were 63% and 87%, respectively. Sensitivity of positive Rome criteria for IBS was 85% with a specificity of 71%. An abnormal calprotectin test had an OR for disease of 27.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.6-43.7; P < 0.0001) compared with ORs of 4.2 (95% Cl, 2.9-6.1; P < 0.0001) and 3.2 (95% CI, 2.2-4.6; P < 0.0001) for elevated CRP and ESR values. An abnormal permeability test gave an OR of 8.9 (95% CI, 5.8-14.0; P < 0.0001) for small intestinal disease. The OR for IBS with positive Rome criteria was 13.3 (95% CI, 8.9-20.0). Conclusions: Fecal calprotectin, intestinal permeability, and positive Rome I criteria provide a safe and noninvasive means of helping differentiate between patients with organic and nonorganic intestinal disease. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Background Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction (leaky gut syndrome, LGS) is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of disorders of the gut brain axis. Endoscopic confocal laser endomicroscopy (eCLE) is an objective measure to test duodenal permeability. We applied this technique in patients with functional gastrointestinal symptoms and food intolerance to characterize the proportion of patients with LGS. Material and Methods In an observational study, we evaluated 85 patients with functional gastrointestinal symptoms and food intolerance. Gastrointestinal symptoms were classified according to Rom IV into functional abdominal pain (FAP), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea dominant (IBS-D), irritable bowel syndrome constipation dominant (IBS-C), irritable bowel syndrome with mixed stool (IBS-M), functional abdominal bloating (FAB), functional diarrhea (FD) and unclassified (NC). During eCLE, spontaneous transfer of intravenously applied fluorescein into duodenal lumen (LGS) and following duodenal food challenge (DFC) were analyzed. Blood analysis comprised parameters of mast cell function, histology of duodenal mucosal biopsies analysis of mucosal inflammation, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) as well as number, distribution and morphology of mast cells. Results 24 patients (9 IBS, 9 FAP, 3 FAB, 1 FD, 2 NC), showed LGS, 50 patients (14 IBS-D, 4 IBS-C, 3 IBS-M, 23 FAP, 3 FAB, 3 NC) had no LGS but responded to DFC and 11 patients (6 NC, 3 FAP, 1 FAB, 1 FD) had no LGS and no response to DFC. The proportion of subgroups with/or without spontaneous leakage of fluorescein (+LGS/-LGS) were IBS-LGS/IBS+LGS 67%/33%, FAP-LGS/FAP+LGS 72%/28%,FAB-LGS/FAB+LGS 50%/50%, NC-LGS/NC+LGS 60%/40%. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences for all parameters tested. Conclusion As a proof of concept, the results of our study indicate that eCLE is a clinical useful tool to evaluate patients with disorders of the gut brain axis and those suspicious of LGS. However, the clinical significance of LGS remains unclear. The study should be an incentive to perform a randomized study including healthy controls. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Berberine (BR) shows promise as a candidate for treating irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). However, the undesired physicochemical properties and poor oral absorption limit its clinical translation. A ketogenic diet (KD) can induce intestinal overexpression of cannabidiol (CB) receptors, which may offer a potential target for IBS-D-specific delivery of BR. Methods: The microemulsions loaded with BR and decorated with cannabidiol (CBD/BR-MEs) were developed through a one-step emulsion method. The pharmaceutical behaviors of the CBD/BR-MEs were measured using dynamic light scattering and high-performance liquid chromatography. The efficacy of the anti-IBS-D therapy was evaluated by assessing fecal water content, Bristol score, and AWR score. The intestinal permeability were assessed through immunofluorescent staining of CB1 and ZO-1, respectively. The signaling of CREB/BDNF/c-Fos was also studied along with immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical examination of brain sections. Results: The CBD/BR-MEs, which had a particle size of approximately 30 nm and a surface density of 2% (wt%) CBD, achieved greater than 80% (wt%) encapsulation efficiency of BR. The pharmacokinetics performance of CBD/BR-MEs was significantly improved in the KD-fed IBS-D rats than the standard diet-fed ones, which is highly related to intestinal expression of CB1 receptors. The treatment with CBD/BR-MEs and KD exhibited evident comprehensive advantages over the other groups in terms of anti-IBS-D efficacy. CBD/BR-MEs and KD synergistically decreased intestinal permeability. Moreover, the treatment with CBD/BR-MEs and KD not only blocked the CREB/BDNF/c-Fos signaling in the brain but also decreased the levels of neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, and inflammatory cytokines in the serum of IBS-D model rats. Conclusion: Such a design represents the first attempt at IBS-D-targeted drug delivery for improved oral absorption and efficacy through KD-induced target exposure, which holds promising potential for the treatment of IBS-D. © 2023 Fan et al.

AB  - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) occurs commonly, is difficult to treat, and frequently recurs. Bovine colostrum (BC) and chicken eggs contain immunoglobulins and other components that possess antimicrobial, immunoregulatory, and growth factor activities; however, it is not known if they have the ability to reduce injury caused by the presence of bacteria associated with SIBO (Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Proteus) and infectious diarrhea (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella). We examined the effects of BC, egg, or the combination, on bacterial growth and bacteria-induced changes in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and bacterial translocation across confluent Caco-2 monolayers. BC, egg, or the combination did not affect bacterial growth. Adding bacteria to monolayers reduced TEER and (with minor variations among species) increased bacterial translocation, increased monolayer apoptosis (increased caspase-3 and Baxα, reduced Bcl2), increased intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and reduced cell adhesion molecules zonulin1 (ZO1) and claudin-1. BC, egg, or the combination reduced these effects (all p < 0.01) and caused additional increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70) expression. We conclude that BC ± egg strength-ens mucosal integrity against a battery of bacteria relevant for SIBO and for infectious diarrhea. Oral BC ± egg may have clinical value for these conditions, especially SIBO where eradication of precipitating organisms may be difficult to achieve. © 2021 by the authors.
